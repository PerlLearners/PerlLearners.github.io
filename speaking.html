<h1>Talks and workshops</h1>

<p class="post-meta">Design&nbsp;workshop</p>

<p>Nina Weber and I gave a workshop to a class of early startups
enrolled in the <span class="caps">START</span> Incubator. We presented intros to and
facilitated exercises on different ways of setting goals,
getting research insights, and prototyping when thinking about
a new product or&nbsp;service.</p>

<h2 id="storytelling">Storytelling in design and&nbsp;engineering</h2>

<p class="post-meta">Design&nbsp;talk</p>

<p>When someone says &#8220;storytelling,&#8221; either marketing or children
bedtime stories come to mind. Both are valid, but far from
being the only places where storytelling appears. Stories are
illustrative, easily memorable and often reach us on an
emotional level. They are very much a part of design and
engineering cultures today; it&#8217;s just that often we&#8217;re not
consciously aware of&nbsp;them.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-git">Understanding&nbsp;Git</h2>

<p class="post-meta">Tech&nbsp;workshop</p>

<p>Git is the most popular version control program in the world.
It is powerful and leaves a lot of freedom to users. That is
great, but without understanding what is happening under the
hood, it can lead to a disaster or can prevent recovering from
one. In the workshop, we covered how Git stores data
internally and what happens when you issue a command. We
discussed principles and underlying structure, and how
different commands map to desired&nbsp;outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-commerce">Mobile commerce: a technical&nbsp;overview</h2>

<p class="post-meta">Tech&nbsp;talk</p>

<p>Smartphones became an essential part of our lives even though
they went mainstream only a few years ago. The consequence is
that we are still learning how people use mobile technology
and especially how they approach mobile shopping. There are
many different ways to build your m-commerce solution, each
with distinct pros and cons. In this talk, I presented what
technology to choose in a particular situation and how each
solution empowers customers and improves online store&nbsp;business. </p>
<p>Event:</p>

<li>Webtanken, conference, 2013-11-28, Kristiansand,&nbsp;Norway</li>

<h2 id="building-modern-software">Building modern software: user experience and&nbsp;design</h2>

<p class="post-meta">Design&nbsp;talk</p>

<p>Do you remember the days when all that was needed was to be
first or have the most features? These days are over. People
have become much smarter and more demanding. The only way to
be successful is to adapt the mindset where design is as
important as engineering. This talk described how designer and
developer roles intertwine from the beginning and how they
should have user&#8217;s goals in mind during the whole&nbsp;project.</p>

<h2 id="half-the-story">Coding is only a half of the&nbsp;story</h2>

<p class="post-meta">Design&nbsp;talk</p>

<p>The other half is client and team communication. This talk
revolved around how visual communication tools—like sketches,
wireframes, and clickable prototypes—help establish a shared
understanding of the&nbsp;project.</p>

<li>Code @ Six, meetup, 2012-03-22, Zagreb,&nbsp;Croatia</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="static-website-generators">Static website&nbsp;generators</h2>

<p class="post-meta">Tech&nbsp;talk</p>

<p>Static websites are fast, secure, and simple. If you need
dynamic parts, you can address it with JavaScript. Static
websites can&#8217;t replace everything, but there are specific
use-cases where static websites outperform other&nbsp;solutions.</p>

<p class="post-meta">Tech&nbsp;talk</p>

<p>Zoran Meliš and I talked about and demonstrated mobile web
development processes and environments. It was only a few
years ago, but mobile technology was very different&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>Event:</p>
<ul>
<li>MobileCamp, conference, 2010-03-27, Ljubljana,&nbsp;Slovenia</li>
</ul>

<p>
Merlin works as an interaction designer at Google and YouTube.
With a computer science degree and a few years of working
as a software engineer, he shifted to design realizing that
you need both design and engineering to make great products.
When not building something new, Merlin can be found reading
or relaxing in nature.
