<h1>A longer version for the&nbsp;curious</h1>
<p><br>
Too many interests and not enough time to indulge in all of
them is my daily struggle. I love learning and applying that
knowledge to solving problems. I&#8217;m humble and satisfied with
life, but also very disciplined and proactive. I come from
Zagreb (Croatia) and Zürich (Switzerland) is my current&nbsp;home.</p>
<h2>Professionally</h2>
<p>I started working as a back-end developer during my computer
science studies. Over time, I drifted towards front-end and
really liked it. Design is closely related to front-end, so I
dabbled in design more and more because of my earlier love for
drawing and&nbsp;psychology.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked mostly in smaller companies on projects for
international clients and markets. I even started a small
studio with a couple of good friends at one point; we had a
great time for a couple of years and tasted the hard life of
running a&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently working as an interaction designer at Google and
YouTube. Web and mobile are where I fight for a better use of
technology and a great user&nbsp;experience.</p>
<h2>Privately</h2>
<p>I like to read and spend time with friends and family when I&#8217;m
not working. I love to exercise and to be outdoors. Over the
course of my life I&#8217;ve tried a lot of physical activities,
sometimes suspecting that I might be &#8220;an exercise&nbsp;addict&#8221;.</p>

learning, you should follow me on
