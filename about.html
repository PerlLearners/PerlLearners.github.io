Too many interests and not enough time to indulge in all of
them is my daily struggle. I love learning and applying that
knowledge to solving problems. I&#8217;m humble and satisfied with
life, but also very disciplined and proactive. I come from
Palakkad&nbsp;(India).</p>
<h2>Professionally</h2>
<p>I started working as a back-end developer after I graduated
in 2007. Over time, I drifted towards scripting languages, 
specially Perl <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Python. I never liked to do front-end 
development and that may be due my lack of creative sense :). 
I will try to get better on it&nbsp;someday.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked mostly in mid sized companies on projects for
international clients and markets. Never tried something on
my own, always dreamt about&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently working as a vfx pipeline developer at <span class="caps">MPC</span>. 
I deal with lot of data every day, however I don&#8217;t do anything
related to data&nbsp;science.</p>
<h2>Privately</h2>
<p>I like to read and spend time with friends and family when I&#8217;m
not working. I love to exercise and to be outdoors. Over the
course of my life I&#8217;ve tried a lot of physical activities,
sometimes suspecting that I might be &#8220;an exercise&nbsp;addict&#8221;.</p></article>
