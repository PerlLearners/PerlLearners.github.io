<p>Life usually leads people down unexpected paths. That&#8217;s the
only explanation I can give myself for holding a short Git
workshop during my vacation in Australia. The friend I&#8217;m
staying with works in a company that plans to change its
source versioning to Git. It came up during a casual
conversation and I mentioned that it&#8217;s a way to go because we
did that a year ago in Five Minutes and never looked back; I
had done a few internal workshops to help the&nbsp;transition.</p>
<p>It quickly got to one of the managers who liked the idea of a
workshop and one was arranged for a few days later. It was a
great way for me to show appreciation for the hospitality, but
also to meet new people and see how they&nbsp;work.</p>
<p><a href="http://syple.com.au/">Syple Technologies</a> is a small software company and it
recently moved into new offices in Sydney center. The
atmosphere is really great and offices beautiful. I really
liked the setting and especially the kanban glass&nbsp;boards.</p>

<p>Fourteen people interested in Git attended the workshop. It
was almost two hours long and I could tell it was a lot of new
stuff for everyone, but questions I was asked told me they
were getting the hang of it. The workshop covered differences
between central and distributed systems, how Git works under
the hood (the general architecture) and a few of the standard
workflows. A half of it was hands-on; I demonstrated how easy
it is to branch and merge, and that it&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> to look and
explore inside <em>.git</em>.</p>
<p>It finished on a very positive note. I hope everyone managed
to get the gist of Git and that they&#8217;ll give it a try. It was
a great experience for me, especially for giving it in English
for the first&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Damir Cuca, one of the co-founders, wrote a very positive
review about the workshop a few days&nbsp;later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had the pleasure of having Merlin present to our
organisation the ins and outs of Git version control. He is
an expert in the field and was able to distil the technology
in an easy to understand manner. He also assisted us in
designing a workflow process that would enable us to use Git
within an agile development environment. This has provided
us with immediate results helping us to streamline our
development and deployment process (saving us time and&nbsp;money!).</p>
<p>He is truly a skilful magician! His skills extend beyond Git
and is an incredibly valuable individual that any
organisation would be grateful to have in their&nbsp;arsenal.</p>
