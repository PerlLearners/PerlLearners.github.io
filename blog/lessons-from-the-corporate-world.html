<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You need to have an&nbsp;opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the thing I wanted to hear, but there it was. My
experienced colleague was explaining the subtleties of working
in a big company and this came up as something you need to do
if you have or want a leadership position. The thinking goes
that the more &#8220;up&#8221; you go, people will look up to you and ask,
&#8220;what to do&#8221;, &#8220;what do you think about this move&#8221;, or &#8220;how
will this affect us&#8221;. You can always say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or
just stay silent in a crowded meeting where other people will
jump in. However, if you want to be seen as a leader, you have
to have an informed opinion. People don&#8217;t follow individuals
who don&#8217;t communicate where they&#8217;re&nbsp;heading.</p>
<p>Even though the tip is short and non-ambiguous, it got me
thinking about other things in big companies that are
different from small companies. The more I&#8217;ve thought about
it, the more I&#8217;ve realized the things are not really that much
different, it&#8217;s just that they don&#8217;t come to prominence in a
small company. If you&#8217;re working in a 20-person shop, everyone
knows everyone else, there is usually one boss (the founder),
and it&#8217;s not as complicated as in a 20,000-person corporation.
However, the tips are relevant in both cases, so I decided to
write down lessons learned coming from a world where 100
people is a lot to a world where 50,000 people is not the
biggest player&nbsp;around.</p>
