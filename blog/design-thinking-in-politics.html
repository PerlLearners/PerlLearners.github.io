<p>Steve Hilton, a former director of strategy for ex-Prime
Minister David Cameron, is a guest in one <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/most-famous-political-operative-america/">Freakonomics podcast
episode</a>. At one point, he talks about his &#8220;transformational
experience&#8221; after learning about design&nbsp;thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I&#8217;d have had the benefit of that experience before I had
the privilege of working in government, I would have been a
hundred times more effective. Because if we adopted in the
government what&#8217;s taught at the d.school, human-centered
design or design thinking– it&#8217;s really simple. You start any
project with an intense focus on the user. Who are you
designing for? Who is supposed to benefit from this? Let&#8217;s
understand their lives. Then you generate some ideas and
before you do anything, you test them out. You turn them
into a very cheap prototype that enables you to get feedback
before you go to the expense of building&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>If [the] parallel is in government, before you actually
start spending real money on implementing a program, you
actually test it out with people, get reactions. That
process of rapid, low-cost prototyping and testing is absent
from the way government operates. If that was present, I
believe you would save so much wasted money and have so much
more effective government&nbsp;programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The situation is slow to improve in politics, but it&#8217;s finally
moving in the right direction. <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/">Government Digital
Services</a> in the <span class="caps">UK</span> started in 2010. They <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs">focused on the
user</a> and completely changed the way digital services are
developed in governments. Their design process matches that of
the industry, and they open-sourced their content and code on
<a href="https://github.com/alphagov">GitHub</a>. The <span class="caps">US</span> recently followed the same example by
starting <a href="https://www.usds.gov/"><span class="caps">USGS</span></a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s wait and see. Or if your country is supportive, get
involved and help now. The sooner the services improve, the
better it will be for&nbsp;everyone.</p></div>
