I gave a talk at WebCamp Zagreb and mentioned a few takeaways
at the end. They were one-liners and I would like to expand on
them as a reminder for those who attended and as an
explanation for those who are just going through <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/merlinrebrovic/blivakker">the
slides</a>.</p>

<h2>1. Keep everyone in the&nbsp;loop</h2>
<p>Communication is the most important factor in any human
endeavour. Everyone should know when, how and what needs to be
done. Use lightweight tools that allow everyone to see what&#8217;s
happening, but don&#8217;t force them to act if they&#8217;re not&nbsp;responsible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s critical for everyone to be aware of how their work
affects others and to be able to communicate that. Calling up
a meeting to disclose what storage system you&#8217;ll use on a
device is a waste of everyone&#8217;s time expect the programmer&#8217;s,
but if it triples a loading time between screens then a <span class="caps">UX</span>
designer should be notified. Knowing where that fine line lies
takes experience and a well-coordinated&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb is that bigger decisions, direction changes
and milestone reviews should be shared across a whole team,
but small day-to-day stuff should touch only those before or
after your work in the pipeline. When that person hears about
a change, she should decide if it affects someone else and
escalate if&nbsp;necessary.</p>

<h2>2. Solve a business and user problem before a technical&nbsp;one</h2>
<p>When we got the brief to adapt an existing solution for
mobile, our first thoughts were not what platform, framework
or language we&#8217;ll use. Although they can be intriguing
questions for a tech-savvy team, they are best left for later.
Considering user and business goals should come first and
technology should follow as an&nbsp;enabler.</p>
<h2>3. Decide what to build before building&nbsp;it</h2>
<p>The thing in this project that really had a great impact was
having a &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; <span class="caps">UX</span> phase after which the rest of the
work was&nbsp;planned.</p>
<p>Outlining the final solution in wireframes and prototypes took
only a minor portion of the total time needed to complete the
whole project, but it gave a very clear picture of the work
that needs to follow. Creating a correct estimate on that is
relatively easy, especially compared to doing one at the start
of the project with only a few sentences as a&nbsp;brief.</p>
