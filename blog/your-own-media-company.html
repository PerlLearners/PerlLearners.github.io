<p>I would like to hear your story. The story about your guiding
principle on sharing your life and work&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>Everyone is their own media company today. The tools and
channels are out there; you just need to grab the reins and
ride into glory. But should&nbsp;you? </p>
<p>There probably isn&#8217;t one correct answer. &#8220;It depends&#8221; comes
closest to it, but that&#8217;s not at all satisfying or actionable.
Improving your online and offline public image usually
benefits your career, and wider exposure leads to more
opportunities and ability to influence, irrespective of an
industry. Moreover, if you&#8217;re selling your business or your
skills as a freelancer, you just have to be out there and&nbsp;hustle.</p>
<p>What if you have a regular job and don&#8217;t need to expose
yourself? What if that just takes time from family and
hobbies? On the other hand, how &#8220;steady&#8221; is that job?
Decades-long positions are things of the past, and future
employers and customers look ever more to your online presence
before deciding to form a relationship with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>In addition to the professional angle, many people desire to
share personal experiences and accomplishments with others
too, especially when social networks allow quick feedback
loops and social validation. That&#8217;s why our feeds are full of
food, vacation photos, and hobbies. It&#8217;s extremely hard to
resist sharing a graduation or a trip of your dreams. But what
is the end goal of sharing publicly? It seems that&#8217;s just a
curation curse where we spend more time on taking and editing
&#8220;a perfect photo&#8221; than in actually enjoying the thing that is
photographed (replace &#8220;photo&#8221; with a tweet, video,&nbsp;etc).</p>
<p>How do you balance this divide between public and private,
online and offline? Reply, send me a message, write a blog
post and link to here; whatever works for you. I would like to
hear your&nbsp;story.</p>
<h2>Update&nbsp;2016-05-07</h2>
<p>There were a couple of public responses to this post, but the
majority came through private channels, both solicited and
unsolicited. This was a bit surprising at first, but after
thinking about it for a while, it makes sense&#8212;many people
don&#8217;t feel comfortable writing publicly about private plans
and motivation behind&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The answers on how much and what is shared varied wildly and
is too diverse to come up with a conclusion. &#8220;It depends&#8221;
won&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was one thing that everyone who contacted
me agreed upon&#8212;having a professional online presence is
helpful in one&#8217;s career regardless of its current&nbsp;state.</p></div>
