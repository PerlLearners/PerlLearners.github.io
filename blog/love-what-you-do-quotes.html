<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>From <a href="/blog/love-what-you-do.html">Love what you do</a>, as a call to welcome less
interesting parts of your&nbsp;pursuit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to embrace all aspects of your current job and do it the
best you can. Fall in love with it, not because it&#8217;s a good
mantra, but because it&#8217;ll make your work&nbsp;outstanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the two and a half years since that post, I have found
some more examples of the same&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p>The first one is from Flow, a book by a psychologist Mihály
Csíkszentmihályi where he summarizes his research of <em>optimal
experience</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another one of our respondents, a worker named Rico
Medellin, gets this feeling quite often on his job. He works
in the same factory as Julio, a little further up on the
assembly line. The task he has to perform on each unit that
passes in front of his station should take forty-three
seconds to perform&#8212;the same exact operation almost six
hundred times in a working&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Most people would grow tired of such work very soon. But
Rico has been at this job for over five years, and he still
enjoys it. The reason is that he approaches his task in the
same way an Olympic athlete approaches his event: How can I
beat my record? Like the runner who trains for years to
shave a few seconds off his best performance on the track,
Rico has trained himself to better his time on the assembly
line. With the painstaking care of a surgeon, he has worked
out a private routine for how use his tools, how to do his
moves. After five years, his best average for a day has been
twenty-eight seconds per&nbsp;unit.</p>
<p>In part he tries to improve his performance to earn a bonus
and the respect of his supervisors. But most often he does
not even let on to others that he is ahead and lets his
success pass unnoticed. It is enough to know that he can do
it, because when he is working at top performance the
experience is so enthralling that it is almost painful for
him to slow&nbsp;down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://danariely.com/books/payoff/">Payoff</a>, a book by a researcher in behavioral
economics Dan&nbsp;Ariely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From time to time, we find ourselves bored and unmotivated
at work or at home. Like Sisyphus, we end up doing the same
humdrum, unrewarding thing over and over. What can we do to
change the situation when it is impossible to change the
circumstances? The answer: change your mental&nbsp;framing.</p>
<p>For example, a young man I know recently took a job at a
hospital, disposing of waste and cleaning surgical
equipment. After a few months on the job, he found it so
boring that he considered quitting. But his mother reminded
him that he had one of the most important jobs in the
hospital because people in hospitals are especially
vulnerable to killer germs like staph. Without his important
work, she explained, these patients could easily become
sicker and die. This shift in perspective renewed his pride
in his job. He performed it with more energy, and not too
long afterward he received a&nbsp;promotion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2015/05/13/andrew-ng_n_7267682.html">Huffington Post interview</a> with Andrew Ng, a
co-founder of Coursera and a machine learning&nbsp;researcher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Is there anything about your education or your early
career that you would have done differently? Any lessons
you&#8217;ve learned that people could benefit&nbsp;from?</p>
<p>A: I wish we as a society gave better career advice to young
adults. I think that &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; is not good
career advice. It&#8217;s actually one of the most terrible pieces
of career advice we give&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about driving your car, it doesn&#8217;t
necessarily mean you should aspire to be a race car driver.
In real life, &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; actually gets amended
to, &#8220;Follow your passion of all the things that happen to be
a major at the university you&#8217;re&nbsp;attending.&#8221;</p>
<p>But often, you first become good at something, and then you
become passionate about it. And I think most people can
become good at almost&nbsp;anything.</p>
