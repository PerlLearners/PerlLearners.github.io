<p>I recently returned from sixteen days of backpacking through
Scandinavia with my wife. Although I could fill a book with
photos and tales of our adventures, I&#8217;m not sure how to do a
good summary, so I&#8217;ll just share a couple of interesting
moments and&nbsp;motives.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2015-07-19_central_norway.jpg" alt="Snowy central Norway." /></p>
<p>This is not what I expected at 1200m in central Norway in
July. I was hoping for cooler temperatures than in Southern
Europe, but this was a surprise. Luckily for us, all of this
was observed from inside a train on a scenic Bergen Line from
Oslo. On the way we stopped to see some&nbsp;fjords.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2015-07-19_norway_fjord.jpg" alt="A fjord from a boat." /></p>
<p>Photos don&#8217;t do fjords justice. It&#8217;s simply impossible to show
how huge and impressive they are. Cliffs rise from the sea
hundreds of meters tall and some even cross one thousand mark,
often with snowy&nbsp;caps.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2015-07-19_norway_viking_ship.jpg" alt="Me behind a viking ship." /></p>
<p>Scandinavian naval history is old and rich, and has shaped the
world as we know it many times. Viking ships are probably the
most recognizable historic artifacts and are frequent motives
in these&nbsp;lands.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2015-07-19_viking_ship_decoration.jpg" alt="Arhitectural viking ship decorations on a column." /></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram">Fram</a> is a monumental ship in Norway&#8217;s history. It was
specially designed for arctic conditions at the end of the
nineteenth century and used for expeditions on the Arctic and
Antarctic regions. It also carried the crew that first reached
the South Pole in&nbsp;1911.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2015-07-19_fram.jpg" alt="Fram's bow in a museum." /></p>
<p>Seeing boats in Denmark isn&#8217;t anything novel by now, but
what&#8217;s behind them is more interesting. It&#8217;s Sunday night and
the streets are bustling with activity. A relaxed and balanced
approach to life is just one factor why Denmark is consistently
rated as one of the happiest countries in the&nbsp;world.</p>

<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2015-07-19_denmark_restaurant.jpg" alt="A restaurant in a historical harbor in Copenhagen." /></p>
<p>Smaller cities and villages still offer a glimpse of the past.
One just needs to turn from the main street and experience
a different&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2015-07-19_old_city_street.jpg" alt="An old city street in Bergen." /></p>
<p>The old Swedish ship called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_%28ship%29">Vasa</a> is what we would call an
epic fail, but with a happy ending. Built in the first half of
the seventeenth century, it managed to sail less than a mile
after launch and then immediately sank due to bad design. It
was salvaged in the 1960s and turned into a museum. Because
it&#8217;s 98% preserved, it serves as an enormous cultural and
historical heritage. An interesting fact is that it served as
an inspiration for ships in the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>.</p>

<p>The smallest statue in Stockholm&#8212;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A4rnpojke">Järnpojke</a>&#8212;often has a
cap by its side to help during cold winter nights. The person
behind knitting is still&nbsp;unknown.</p>

<p>A beautiful sunset is the best way to finish a journey,
especially if it&#8217;s just before&nbsp;midnight.</p>
