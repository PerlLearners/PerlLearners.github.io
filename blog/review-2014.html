<p>What a year. So many things happened it&#8217;s impossible to list
them all. I&#8217;ll start from the most life changing&#8212;living&nbsp;abroad.</p>
<h2>People all over the&nbsp;place</h2>
<p>I got married this year, but even my wife would agree that
moving to Switzerland was the most significant event for us.
We were aware of the trade-offs&#8212;more opportunities for growth
and more distance from family and friends. The former is
great, the latter not so much. There are two things I&nbsp;noticed:</p>
<ol>
<li>I stay in touch with most of the people the same number of
   times per year as before. Everyone has a couple of friends
   they see very often&#8212;excluding work colleagues&#8212;and all
   others they meet once in a while. For example, family
   gatherings, weddings, class reunions, birthdays,
   professional conferences and similar events are the most
   common meeting points. I try to time my travel with those
   events and things somehow work&nbsp;out.</li>
<li>Making new friends is not easy. People form more habits as
   they get older, they start families and develop specific
   interests and rhythms. It becomes harder to find people
   fitting a specific profile as time goes on. Luckily for us,
   we met some nice people in&nbsp;Zürich.</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<p>I&#8217;ve had friends and family abroad before I moved, so I&#8217;m used
to email, chat or video communication. It&#8217;s not ideal, but
it&#8217;s better than nothing. While it&#8217;s highly improbable, but
possible, to stumble upon an old friend walking down a street
of a foreign city, it&#8217;s relatively easy to stay in touch.
Nevertheless, one of the most frequent replies I get&nbsp;is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh hi, so nice to hear from you. I was planning to send you
a message, but never got around to actually doing&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a life tip that will make a lot of people happy. Send a
message to a friend you didn&#8217;t hear for a long time the moment
you think of him or her. A short message can be on its way in
about twenty seconds and could start a beautiful&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>My grandfather called his friend the other day to wish him
merry Christmas. They know each other for 64 years. Let it
sink in. Six&nbsp;decades.</p>
<h2>Switzerland</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a small and diverse country which I didn&#8217;t have time to
explore yet and that&#8217;s one of small regrets I have from the
last year. Starting a new life and business travel take a lot
of time so I&#8217;ll use this year to explore &#8220;the island in the
center of Europe&#8221;. I&#8217;ll ride their <a href="/blog/danke-schon-zvv.html">impeccable public
transit</a> to different regions where I won&#8217;t understand a
word of <a href="/blog/foreign-languages.html">local dialects</a>. Expect photos and reports&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>Corporation</h2>

<p>Working with a couple of friends at a small studio or with
dozens of colleagues at an agency is one thing. Being a part
of tens of thousands in Google is something completely
different. It&#8217;s hard to measure company-wide impact of an
individual at that scale. It&#8217;s hard because it&#8217;s immeasurable
for the majority of corporate warriors and that can be&nbsp;demoralizing. </p>
<p>I was thinking a lot about a construction analogy in the last
few months. A dozen men can build a small house and they see
impact of their work every day. They can build a lot of houses
over time, but they can never build a skyscraper. Time,
knowledge, infrastructure and capital required to build
something so big is beyond a handful of&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Search, Maps, YouTube and Android are Burj Khalifas of the
digital world and I&#8217;m a highly skilled construction worker. I
can&#8217;t say I built a skyscraper by myself, but my work
certainly helped. Having a clear vision where the company or a
product is going and how to contribute is paramount if I want
to find meaning in my daily&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Working with so many colleagues has some really nice benefits.
People with <a href="/blog/ux-field-diversity.html">diverse backgrounds or roles</a> are more
accessible, making it easier to get feedback and new insights.
Both are a necessary part of&nbsp;learning.</p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>From <a href="/blog/mallorca.html">sandy beaches of Mallorca</a> to <a href="/blog/cold-san-francisco.html">cold San Francisco</a>
and from <a href="/blog/educational-taxi-ride.html">tech-savvy cab riders</a> to <a href="/blog/swiss-precision.html">costly Swiss
precision</a>, last year was rewarding once again. Every trip,
pleasant or not, allowed me to experience something new. It&#8217;s
funny for me to say this because I wasn&#8217;t keen on travel when
I was younger. But now &#8230; now I&#8217;m&nbsp;wiser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world is a book and those who do not travel read only
one&nbsp;page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I noticed something interesting when I got back to my hometown
for holidays&#8212;I&#8217;m constantly surprised to hear Croatian spoken
around me. Living abroad for nine months forced me to use
English and German almost exclusively, except when talking to
family and old friends. Everyone around me speaks some other
language and I learned to expect it, so I became super
sensitive to hearing Croatian in a crowd. That works for New
York, but it drives me crazy in Croatia for obvious reasons&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>All in all, it was an exceptional year. If 2015 packs only
half of last year&#8217;s excitement, I will be delighted. Happy New
Year, dear&nbsp;reader.</p></div>
