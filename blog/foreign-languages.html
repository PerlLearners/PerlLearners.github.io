<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Foreign languages are a very uncomfortable place for most
people. Most have been learning at least one in school for
years, but never got it to the point where it can be used
comfortably in daily life. Many like the idea of learning a
new language, but never dedicate time to do it. When
confronted by a tourist who needs directions, the brain stops
working and the voice&nbsp;disappears.</p>
<p>Some of these statements are true for me, too. English is the
only foreign language where I feel comfortable; with listening
and reading very close to a native level and speaking with an
accent, but good enough to get away from most conversations
unscathed. Other than that, I can say &#8220;sausage&#8221; in German,
&#8220;dance&#8221; in Spanish and a few proverbs in&nbsp;Latin.</p>
<p>And then I moved to&nbsp;Zürich.</p>
<h2>Languages of&nbsp;Switzerland</h2>
<p>The experience has been like taking someone whose only
experience with water was drinking and showering, and dropping
him in the middle of a cold ocean. Switzerland has four
official languages and English is not one of them. Adding
insult to the injury, standard German is used in writing in
the German speaking area, but almost everyone in Zürich area
speaks Swiss German which is different enough so even native
German speakers have problems understanding&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>I heartily recommend a more thorough take on the complexity
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Switzerland">&#8220;Languages of Switzerland&#8221;</a>. I promise
you&#8217;ll find some very interesting facts. For example, Romansh
is one of the official languages and a direct descendant of
the spoken Latin. It&#8217;s spoken by 1% of the population and has
five dialects. Crazy,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>The only comforting thought for me is that the top immigrant
language and the fourth in general is Serbo-Croatian; it
really helped on some&nbsp;occasions.</p>
<h2>Languages of Google&nbsp;Zürich</h2>
<p>Google&#8217;s Switzerland office is the biggest engineering office
outside the <span class="caps">US</span> and draws talent from all around the world.
It&#8217;s very diverse compared to some other more locally oriented
offices, with the official web site boasting around 75
nationalities. Although the company language is English,
people often speak their native languages with colleagues and
friends during breaks and lunches. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;ve never
heard so many in such a short timespan in my life. That&#8217;s
without counting languages so strange to me that I can&#8217;t even
discern them from&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>I have a feeling everyone speaks at least three languages and
on occasion they go beyond that; eight languages is the
current record I personally know of. That sometimes makes me
feel genuinely uneducated. On the other hand, it also serves
as a motivation, although I&#8217;m not sure how long it will take
me to become comfortable with another language. It would
certainly take less time if I practiced more and ranted less
on how I don&#8217;t know too many of them&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2>Learning, speaking and&nbsp;pronunciation</h2>
<p>What is the best way to learn a foreign language? By speaking
it from the start. Even if you know only two sentences, try to
speak them out loud. I came up to that conclusion mostly from
polyglots I had talked to, some good books I had read and from
a way some very good learning systems are made, but also from
my experience learning&nbsp;German.</p>
<p>Many people usually try to learn a language by reading and
sometimes listening (to music, movies, etc). By doing that you
can get to a reasonably good level of understanding written
word, but only that. If you&#8217;re forced to actually ask a
question or introduce yourself at a party, I bet you wouldn&#8217;t
be able to do it or at least there is a very big chance people
will not understand you, meaning your language is not very&nbsp;functional.</p>
<p>It happened to me a number of times in the last few months.
I&#8217;m speaking English and sometimes people do not understand
me, foreigners and native speakers alike. I was confused
because I&#8217;m not that bad. What happened? I know a lot of words
when I read them, but 90% of them I have never actually said
out loud because my English conversations were too short and
focused. My pronunciation was not clear and sometimes even
incorrect. What had seemed as a minor difference to me was a
stumbling point for my listeners. English, even if it seems
&#8220;familiar&#8221; to a lot of people, has many pronunciation traps
that are made obvious only when you dig in&nbsp;deeper.</p>
<p>Being a geek, I had to find a linguistics book that explains
this problem in more depth. It turns out each language covers
only a subset of all sounds a human speaking apparatus can
produce. We often use sounds from our mother language to speak
a foreign one and this is where the problems start. The issues
are ranging from having an accent to mentioning someone&#8217;s
mother if similar sounds completely change the meaning. And
that&#8217;s only sounds, without touching the structure and other
things. If you want to see the full range of sounds,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> (<span class="caps">IPA</span>) is what you&nbsp;seek.</p>
<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>Having such diversity around you brings up some interesting&nbsp;points:</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, your native language will be understood only
  by a fraction of the world&#8217;s population. In other words,
  almost nobody. It&#8217;s worth learning at least one of the
  more popular&nbsp;ones.</li>
<li>When we don&#8217;t speak a language, we distance ourselves from
  those who do. We find them different and erect barriers
  between us. I find that very sad. On the other hand,
  speaking the same language has a tendency to pull people&nbsp;together.</li>
<li>Other people don&#8217;t talk funny, we all do. We use different
  sounds and structures to convey the same thoughts. And it&#8217;s
  very important to follow that when speaking a foreign
  language because you won&#8217;t be understood. It certainly
  motivated me to try to speak &#8220;weird sounds&#8221; although I still
  sound silly to myself&nbsp;sometimes.</li>
<li>The languages are living and dynamic phenomenons. They
  change constantly, although very slowly so it&#8217;s hard to
  notice. If you&#8217;re a programmer, just image an evolution of
  a programming language stretched over centuries and not&nbsp;decades.</li>
<li>The world is much more interesting place than our daily
  routine&nbsp;suggests.</li>
</ul>
<p>For someone who had thought foreign languages are fun as
changing diapers, I must admit they are a source of
fascination for the last few months&nbsp;:)</p>
