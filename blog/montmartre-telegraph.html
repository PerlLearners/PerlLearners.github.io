<figcaption class="figure-caption">An old telegraph in France used a mechanical semaphore on
top of the tower to signal letters according to the Chappe
system. Nearby stations would observe it and relay it further.</figcaption>

<p>People, companies, and governments downplaying new technology
and being left behind is nothing new. Here is an example on
early mechanical telegraphy and semaphores from the first half
of the nineteenth century, as described by James Gleick in his
excellent book <em>The Information</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A communications infrastructure built with enormous
government investment and capable of transmitting some
hundreds of total words per day could hardly be used for
private messaging. That was unimaginable&#8212;and when, in the
next century, it became imaginable, some governments found
it undesirable. No sooner did entrepreneurs begin to
organize private telegraphy than France banned it outright:
an 1837 law mandated imprisonment and fines for &#8220;anyone
performing unauthorized transmissions of signals from one
place to another, with the aid of telegraphic machines or by
any other means.&#8221; The idea of a global nervous system had to
arise elsewhere. In the next year, 1838, the French
authorities received a visit from an American with a
proposal for a &#8220;telegraph&#8221; utilizing electrical wires:
Samuel F B. Morse. They turned him down flat. Compared to
the majestic semaphore, electricity and seemed gimcrack and
insecure. No one could interfere with telegraph signals in
the sky, but wire could be cut by saboteurs. Jules Guyot, a
physician and scientist assigned to assess the technology,
sniffed, &#8220;What can one expect of a few wretched wires?&#8221; What&nbsp;indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has happened before, it&#8217;s happening now, and it will happen
in the future. As much as history is a good teacher, we never
learn from&nbsp;it.</p></div>
