<p><a href="/blog/three-days-to-sydney-part-one.html">Deja vu</a>. Goodbyes, a security and passport check, a bus
ride aaaaand no turboprop airplane :) Wow, this time we might
even fly over&nbsp;Slovenia.</p>
<h2>Hour&nbsp;0</h2>
<p>Team Sydney, the three person cell of combined age of more
than 150 years, prepared for take off. I was sitting next to
an emergency exit which means I had 20cm of legroom more. For
a tall guy like me, it&#8217;s a lifesaver. The flight was shaky,
but&nbsp;uneventful.</p>
<p>Frankfurt met us with cold and rain. We got out, drove on a
train to another terminal and sat for a drink in front of our
gate. Leo, the eldest team member, started talking about his
early life and how his brother, one of eleven kids, emigrated
to Australia. It was during 1950s while he was still very
young. He traveled by ship for 35 days. 28 hours we were
about to make seemed like a blink of an eye. We finished our
drinks and headed for the&nbsp;gate.</p>
<h2>Hour 4,&nbsp;Qantas</h2>
<p>Australian airline Qantas is the second oldest in the world,
dating from 1920s. During boarding their Boeing 747 I noticed
most of the staff was 40 or older and almost of them were men.
And not just any men - they looked like the whole James Bond
lineup. Suits, well groomed, had class. Only a darker beach
tan and an Aussie accent gave them away. When I think about it
now, they probably have a storage on an airplane where they
keep women&#8217;s underwear that&#8217;s thrown at them during a&nbsp;flight.</p>
<p>I was sitting between two people, but when the pilot said that
there were many free seats and we could relocate after the
seatbelt sign turned off, I became a man with a&nbsp;mission.</p>
<h2>Hour&nbsp;5</h2>
<p>The taxi and the take-off took a while, but when the sign
turned off, I was in a low start and ready. Fifteen seconds
later I got myself a seat next to an aisle which allowed me to
extend my legs. It was a time for a meal after which the
lights were turned off and that was the cue for us to go to
sleep. It was midnight local time and the sleep came&nbsp;easy.</p>
<h2>Hour&nbsp;9</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m wide awake after only three hours. This is not good; we
still have seven hours to go. I started watching a few <span class="caps">TED</span>
videos on my phone. Luckily for me, they weren&#8217;t very good
(I&#8217;m complaining about that lately), so it was as fun as
trying to memorize renaissance history in high school. In
other words, I dropped dead like a&nbsp;log.</p>
<p>Just a note for future flights. Foam ear plugs can isolate
four extra powerful jet engines, but a baby&#8217;s cry will cut
through them like a hot knife through butter. Babies are
trolls; cute, but still&nbsp;trolls.</p>
<h2>Hour&nbsp;15</h2>
<p>I slowly woke up when the staff turned the lights on. I found
myself pushed out of my seat by a granny who occupied three
seats already. Her husband was stretched over the whole row
behind us, so she wanted to follow his example. And I was in
the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>A smell of the second in-flight meal spread through the cabin
and the granny woke up with a smile. At least someone had a
good and uninterrupted sleep. Meals were hot and tasty, and
they kept me full during the flight. When the crew took away
our dishes, the pilot announced a technical stop in Singapore
for cleaning and refueling. I really needed it; more than
twelve hours of sitting made some parts of my body&nbsp;numb.</p>
<h2>Hour 18,&nbsp;Singapore</h2>
<p>I rushed through the gate and headed straight for the
bathroom. I won&#8217;t go into any details, but beware of the
toilets. They aren&#8217;t triggered by handles, but by proximity
sensors. You have to sit very straight all the time to be
close to the wall. If you bend forward even a little, it will
flush. Guess how I found that out. On the other hand, I
welcomed the surprising&nbsp;refreshment.</p>
<p>A fresh shirt, wet wipes and a toothbrush can be a
resurrection on such long flights so be sure to pack them with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Two things caught my attention: free Internet, and kids in
military uniforms and bulletproof vests, holding machine guns.
Other than that, just an ordinary&nbsp;airport.</p>
<p>I went through the procedures and paperwork with Leo and Mary,
and then helped them by translating on a security check. We
boarded the plane again and were ready for the last leg of the&nbsp;trip.</p>
<h2>Hour 20, Are we there&nbsp;yet?</h2>
<p>I got the middle seat again, but this time the flight was
full, so I was stuck. The fact that I wasn&#8217;t sleepy at all
made it even worse. It was midday back home and while most of
the passengers were sound asleep after a meal, I&#8217;ve managed to
go through a 250 page book about Sydney, watched a few
videos and then started another book. The seven and a half
hour flight was slow. Really, really slow. <span class="caps">S. L. O. W.
</span>Sssssllooooo &#8230; <span class="caps">OK</span>, you get the&nbsp;picture.</p>
<h2>Hour&nbsp;28</h2>
<p>I was so happy when I saw Sydney for the first time during
descent. It marked the end of this too long voyage. From
Sunday 17:35 in Zagreb (the first try) to Wednesday 6:55 in&nbsp;Sydney.</p>
<p>I took Team Sydney through the passport and customs control,
and then to baggage claim. I reported some stuff they thought
could be suspicious, so a dog had to sniff me and my baggage.
He looked at me, winked and reported (barked)&nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>Leo&#8217;s family was waiting for us outside. They were so happy to
see Team Sydney arrive safely and they thanked me through
tears in a mix of Croatian and English. I wasn&#8217;t prepared for
this much affection, but was very happy to help the people in
need. We parted ways and I headed off for the&nbsp;train.</p>
