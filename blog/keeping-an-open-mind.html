<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I&#8217;m reading a couple of books at the&nbsp;moment:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/thinking-about-cybersecurity-from-cyber-crime-to-cyber-warfare.html">Thinking About Cybersecurity</a><br />
   This is actually a course by professor Paul Rosenzweig.
   It&#8217;s a more objective and academic view on the size and
   open nature of the Internet and all threats that come with
   that&nbsp;model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.howgoogleworks.net/">How Google Works</a><br />
   A book by Eric Schmidt <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Jonathan Rosenberg about lessons
   they learned as they helped build Google. It&#8217;s mostly about
   company culture, internal processes communication and&nbsp;innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/when-google-met-wikileaks/">When Google Met WikiLeaks</a><br />
   A transcript of the interview Julian Assange and Eric
   Schmidt had in 2011. Assange shows impressive understanding
   of internal workings of the web, but also uses commentary
   in the book to incriminate Google&#8217;s leadership for
   non-transparent involvements with the <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;government.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Common themes are security, privacy and communication. Reading
books with different takes on the topics allows me to see
different perspectives and doesn&#8217;t let me slip into one
narrow, potentially limiting,&nbsp;mindset.</p>
<p>Assange often cites <a href="http://www.newdigitalage.com/">The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future
of People, Nations and Business</a> by Schmidt and Cohen,
which I read last year. It shares more topics with When Google
Met WikiLeaks than How Google Works. One thing I clearly
remember from The New Digital Age is how much space was
dedicated to cyberterrorism. If I pulled the gist from my
memory, it would go like this. <em>As more and more things move
to the web, an online identity becomes even more important and
will be frequent target for cyber attacks. It&#8217;s up to private
sector and government to work together and protect it.</em> I
understand how a person in Assange&#8217;s position might find that&nbsp;worrying.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in 2012 I read <a href="http://www.abundancethebook.com/">Abundance: The Future Is
Better Than You Think</a> by Peter Diamandis and Steven
Kotler. The authors say exponential improvements in technology
are positive and will eventually solve all, or at least most,
problems we face today: diseases, deteriorating environment,
hunger, education, energy&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>Most of these books are forward looking so it&#8217;s really hard to
tell which scenario will prevail. Nobody can predict the
future after all, but even then it&#8217;s good to be aware of
forces which pull in different directions. Always read,
explore and keep an open&nbsp;mind.</p></div>
