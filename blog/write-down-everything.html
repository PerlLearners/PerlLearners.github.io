<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>To be more specific, write down everything <strong>important</strong>.
Early in my corporate career, I asked an experienced designer
what had helped him make the transition from a small agency to
a big company. He suggested that I should keep a permanent
track of what&#8217;s happening for myself. Projects change and
people come and go so it&#8217;s hard to keep everything in&nbsp;memory.</p>
<p>I took his advice to heart. I&#8217;ve started a journal for each
project I&#8217;ve worked on and have been doing it since. Even
though there is a small overhead to writing them, there are
two huge&nbsp;benefits:</p>
<h2>1. No&nbsp;ambiguity</h2>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re doing A.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ermm … I thought we&#8217;re doing B. Isn&#8217;t that what we decided at the beginning of the year?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure it was A. I&#8217;ve talked with Claire and Lucas about it.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But A is completely at odds with our goal. Are you sure it&#8217;s not B? Claire left the company in the meantime and Lucas is on a parental leave, so it&#8217;s going to be hard to check what you had&nbsp;discussed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This will happen. However, I want it to happen once a year,
not every week. Recording decisions, reasons, and thoughts
makes it easy to recall them later. To save time, I often copy
email snippets or meeting notes. In the spirit of open
collaboration, all my project journals are open to everyone. I
can point people to specific sections, and they can review and&nbsp;comment.</p>
<h2>2. Clear&nbsp;thoughts</h2>
<p>When I can&#8217;t copy summaries, I have to write them myself. The
act of writing forces me to think through the decision or
activity once again, and it serves as an additional&nbsp;check.</p>
<h2>What about project management&nbsp;tools?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen project management tools work well in smaller
companies. However, as the number of teams and diverse
projects increases, the lowest common denominator for
cross-team communication quickly becomes the holy trinity:
emails, issue trackers, and documents. Additional hurdles to
finding a common tool everyone uses are &#8220;not invented here
syndrome&#8221; and security&nbsp;concerns.</p>
<p>If everyone in your team and all your collaborators use one
tool to track progress and communicate, you&#8217;re in a good
place. If not, make your own notes. You&#8217;ll thank yourself&nbsp;later.</p>
