<p>Talking to inanimate objects usually meant people need
professional help. Sometimes we say nasty things to a leaking
washing machine or a <span class="caps">TV</span> showing a football match, but we never
talk to a fridge or a hairdryer. Things are slowly changing
with phones and computers, but we&#8217;re still using it to talk to
other people, not devices. What happens when there isn&#8217;t a
person on the other side? And why aren&#8217;t we doing it&nbsp;more?</p>
<h2>Slow&nbsp;adoption</h2>
<p>Despite speech recognition being available in consumer
electronics for a long time, it hasn&#8217;t been used much in
everyday situations. I think there are a couple of&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technology wasn&#8217;t good enough<br />
   I don&#8217;t remember one piece of everyday technology that was
   doing it right. For example, I was trying it out on Windows
   Mobile a while back. There were pre-set voice commands, but
   they were very limited and if my pronunciation wasn&#8217;t
   perfect or if I said a non-English name, I hit a wall. To
   be fair, it&#8217;s a very tough problem to solve on a computer
   even if humans understand each other without problems. But
   we&#8217;re seeing some good progress recently. Ubiquity of
   Internet access on many devices and powerful software
   running in the cloud really makes a difference in the last
   year or&nbsp;two.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foreign languages<br />
   If people don&#8217;t speak English or some other major language,
   they are out of luck. Support for non-dominant languages is
   still not very&nbsp;functional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social norms<br />
   Many notes, commands and searches are awkward when said out
   loud in public transit or while waiting in a queue, even if
   they could be perfectly normal in proper context. And there
   are some places, like classrooms, where talking is frowned&nbsp;upon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Isn&#8217;t that from a sci-fi movie?&#8221;<br />
   Believe it or not, there are people who don&#8217;t know speech
   recognition is functional and available on their
   smartphones today. It hasn&#8217;t been until only recently and
   nobody told them something changed. If people don&#8217;t know
   something is possible, they won&#8217;t try&nbsp;it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Potential</h2>
<p>I think there are many areas where voice will be the optimal
input method and that will push adoption and&nbsp;quality.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Young generations<br />
   Kids start to talk before they can write so this could be
   their second way of interacting with technology after
   touch. &#8220;Play cartoons with cute bears&#8221; is something a four
   year old can say, but not write. They will carry those
   interactions into their adult age and they won&#8217;t feel so&nbsp;awkward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed<br />
   Unless a person is typing all day for a living, speech is a
   faster input method than a keyboard. When we get to
   negligible number of speech recognition errors, it could
   replace a lot of typing. Just think of transcribing
   interviews, meeting notes, medical examinations or chatting
   in real time with someone who has to receive text. Benefits
   like that will shift a lot of usage to&nbsp;voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessibility<br />
   It will be a game-changer for visually impaired people or
   those with physical disabilities (eg. tremors or
   repetitive stress injuries). There are many others who will
   find it useful, of&nbsp;course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context<br />
   Driving, playing games and cooking are some activities
   where hands are busy and voice is free to ask and&nbsp;command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>A perfect&nbsp;example</h2>
<p><img src="/media/external/2014-10-29_google_translate.jpg" alt="Google Translate Android application." /></p>
<p>I received a new version of my health insurance contract last
week. It was a couple of pages in German and I could get the
gist, but there were a lot of unknown words; they tend to be
important in contracts, especially in fine print. I opened
Google Translate app and selected voice input. Every time I
stumbled upon an unknown word, I would say it in German and
get the English word spoken back. It was so fast I was able to
read the whole document in a matter of minutes and it was
almost like having a native speaker by my&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>Who knows where it will take us in a couple of years, but I&#8217;m
sure it will be&nbsp;interesting.</p></div>
