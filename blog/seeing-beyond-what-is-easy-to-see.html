<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>He did it again. Every morning he runs down a corridor and
joins a meeting ten minutes too late. Such an irresponsible
guy. He&#8217;s never on time and shows no respect to&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Most of us jump to this conclusion without any effort. But
what if we knew that person better? What if we knew what that
person does and thinks every day, hour by hour? And if we
found out he has to choose between catching an early train to
arrive on time and a later one that leaves him an hour more to
spend with his terminally ill daughter, would we think of him&nbsp;differently?</p>
<p>People are complex beings. There are many layers and
dimensions to each of us and most of them are hidden. We
forget that we see the consequences, but not the causes, and
so we link people&#8217;s behavior to their character more than to
external factors. In psychology, this bias is known as the
<em>fundamental attribution error</em>.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;exercise</h2>
<p>To avoid this bias as much as possible, I do a particular
exercise when I have time to spare. Airports and train
stations are good places because there are a lot of people
around. I find one person and observe. What do I&nbsp;see?</p>
<p>Oh, here&#8217;s one. A teen in a leather jacket and tight worn-out
jeans. Long and messy pink hair intertwine with headphone
wires connected to an iPod. She looks tired and&nbsp;resigned.</p>
<p>The stage is set. Can I hear her internal monologue?<br />
<em>The party last night was great, but coming home at 4 in the
morning means I have to explain myself to my dear mother.
Again. She&#8217;s such a pain. She worries about minor things, sets
stupid curfews, and probably wants to stop me from doing
everything she&#8217;s done when she was my age. Lucky me she
doesn&#8217;t know about Justin. I hope he&#8217;ll bring booze tonight.
And other things. I can&#8217;t afford it since the witch-mother
slashed my allowance. Oh I hate&nbsp;her.</em></p>
<p>This was too easy. Disturbing, right? I&#8217;ll try a different
version.<br />
<em>I wasn&#8217;t invited to a birthday party, again. Nothing worked
in the last year and it seems I just can&#8217;t fit in. I even
destroyed my hair by following their pointless trends. Oh my,
the exam for the music academy is in four weeks. I would
really love to get in, but evenings are busy escorting my
little brother to the play group, so I can practice only late
at night. I won&#8217;t make it. The only upside of a blind audition
is they won&#8217;t see sagging bags under my eyes and this pink
monstrosity. Huh. If girls in the school knew about the
violin, they wouldn&#8217;t talk to me at all. Who cares. Bach&nbsp;rocks.</em></p>
<p>One more.<br />
<em>Damn dogs. They come as fluffy puppies, get under your skin,
become a member of the family, and then leave too early. I
miss you&nbsp;Dot.</em></p>
<p>Three different narratives, three different impressions. If I
tell myself only one story, I tend to stick with it and
declare it <em>the truth</em>. But as I imagine more scenarios, the
chance of any one being true approaches zero. This helps me
internalize that the first explanation that comes to mind for
someone&#8217;s behavior is probably wrong. It also builds
tolerance towards other&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Noticing someone&#8217;s behavior is easy, but seeing beyond that,
understanding the cause, is hard. Don&#8217;t do it&nbsp;lightly.</p></div>
