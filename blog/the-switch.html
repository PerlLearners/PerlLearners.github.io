<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>The face in front of me is familiar. It shows a hint of
surprise and disbelief, with a swarm of questions behind it.
Only one gets out:&nbsp;&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the reaction I get when engineers find out I switched
from software development to design. The question often comes
up when I meet new people professionally and this was also the
case after joining Google. I shared my reasoning so many times
I finally decided to write it&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Working as a software engineer on customer facing or
business-to-business products means you&#8217;ll usually get the
specification (documents, mocks, prototypes) and implement it.
Almost everything has been defined by the time you start and
it&#8217;s very hard to change it. This is a critical point and I
want you to realize the consequence&#8212;the vast greatness of
your engineering skills won&#8217;t matter at all if you&#8217;re solving
a wrong problem or solving the right problem in a wrong way.
For example, by building a terrible user interface. <a href="/blog/fanatical-devotion-to-great-software.html">Beautiful
code and architecture</a> wasted on something like that is a
depressing thought, at least for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Finding a team with a proven process where everyone gets an
opportunity to share their own expertise during outlining the
initial solution is rare. The waterfall method&#8212;with specific
phases well defined and people siloed&#8212;is still very&nbsp;common.</p>
<p>My idea was that by moving up the pipeline I would be able to
influence the problem solving part a bit more. The pipeline
usually starts with product/project managers and designers
following closely. I&#8217;ve tried both roles, but leaned more
towards design because more hands-on work gets done there. The
good news is that this idea has been validated&#8212;since I
switched I have been able to outline right solutions
completely or at least steer it in the right&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>Two questions usually follow: one asked out loud, the other
left hanging in the&nbsp;air.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Do you miss coding?&#8221; is the loud one. Yes, I do. But I&#8217;m also
very satisfied with what I&#8217;m doing at the moment and that
takes away some of the pain. I also work on my website, build
prototypes for testing and help with front-end stuff so it&#8217;s
not like I don&#8217;t know how to exit Vim&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>The second one is: &#8220;Are engineers just implementors who can&#8217;t
contribute to problem solving?&#8221; Absolutely not. It&#8217;s sad some
people have that sentiment. Engineers amass a lot of
technical knowledge and expertise. They bring a different
perspective and innovative ideas to the table; that&#8217;s why I
always try to bring them in early during the&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s it folks, the reasoning behind the switch, for
better or worse. My working experience is split evenly between
design and engineering up to this point in time. I&#8217;m looking
forward to see what happens in the future&#8212;will one prevail or
will a third option take&nbsp;over.</p></div>
