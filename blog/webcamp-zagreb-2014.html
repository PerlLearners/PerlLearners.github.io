<p>Yes, it was great. Words can&#8217;t express the feeling of meeting
new people and catching up with old friends and
colleagues&#8212;especially after me being away for a long time.
But something else happened to me during the last couple of
days and I would like to share it with&nbsp;you.</p>
<h2>My&nbsp;talk</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"
            data-link-color="#06736C"             data-dnt="true">     <p>@merlinrebrovic presentation started

<p>The subject of my talk &#8220;<a href="http://2014.webcampzg.org/speakers/merlin-rebrovic-storytelling-in-design-and-engineering/">Storytelling in design and
engineering</a>&#8221; is very interesting, but tough to work with.
I picked it because I see a lot of value in knowing how to use
it in everyday communication. But even with plenty of
preparation, it didn&#8217;t fully convey the intended message,
which is a bit ironic considering the title. The expectations
were very high after the <a href="/blog/webcamp-zagreb-2012.html">last</a> <a href="/blog/webcamp-zagreb-2013-talk.html">two</a> years and I feel I
fell a bit&nbsp;short.</p>
<p>But something else followed that totally blew my mind. People
approached me throughout the day, both close friends and total
strangers, offering their thoughts about the talk. <em>&#8220;We know
each other for years, so here are my thoughts.&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Hi. We
don&#8217;t know each other, but I feel like I can tell you
something and that there won&#8217;t be any hard&nbsp;feelings.&#8221;</em> </p>
<p>I have to tell you, hearing an honest and constructive
criticism was not easy, not at all. But it was good for two&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone was positive, honest and had consistent feedback.
   It all pointed in the same direction, so I know how to
   improve&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>I was totally floored by realizing that people feel safe
   around me and trust me not to take things personally. This
   kind of environment, where people can talk openly and with
   candor, is rare and invaluable. I believe it&#8217;s the only way
   a person or a whole community can improve and grow over
   time. Thank you for talking to&nbsp;me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing openly and exposing myself like this is not comfortable,
but I feel it perfectly describes the spirit of WebCamp
community. The conference didn&#8217;t start with a profit in mind
and there was no corporate agenda&#8212;just a bunch of enthusiasts
wanting to create a place where people can meet and share
their experiences. And it&#8217;s great to see that it kept its
essence even after three years and huge&nbsp;growth.</p>
<p>Update 2014-11-26:<br />
<em>Based on received feedback, I&#8217;ve given a really good talk in
Berlin and later published its contents in a <a href="/blog/storytelling-in-design-and-engineering.html">separate
post</a>.</em></p>

<h2>My&nbsp;workshop</h2>
<p>Luckily, my &#8220;<a href="http://2014.webcampzg.org/workshops/merlin-rebrovic-understanding-git/">Understanding Git</a>&#8221; workshop on Friday was a
triumph. The attentive and curious group of 25 kept
discussions smart and relevant, so we stayed overtime to cover
extra topics. The atmosphere mimicked a comfy café&#8212;the
chatting was relaxed and friendly. It&#8217;s not surprising the
positive reactions went through the&nbsp;roof.</p>

<p>And this is not just a happy coincidence. I&#8217;ve been doing Git
workshops for three years now and I&#8217;ve tried a couple of
approaches during that time. The workshops were helpful when I
started, but some people didn&#8217;t seem to connect all the dots.
I was smart enough at that time to ask for a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of feedback
which formed the workshop into something that packs loads of
essential information in just a few&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>The main take away? Try, don&#8217;t be afraid to fail, ask for
feedback, keep your ego under control and have an open&nbsp;mind.</p></div>
