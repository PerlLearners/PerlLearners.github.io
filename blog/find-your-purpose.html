<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>My work matters,&#8221; you think to yourself. In a small studio,
shop, or a startup, everything you do is significant. You can
see your contributions pushing the business forward every day.
You feel good about&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re 1 of 3 people in a company, you&#8217;re almost a
superhero. If you&#8217;re 1 of 30, you might still feel you&#8217;re
contributing. But if you&#8217;re 1 of 3000, can you recognize your
impact on the whole business every day? If you leave for three
months, you&#8217;ll find the company somehow survived without you.
Shocking,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>This realization can be demotivating so you might start saying
to yourself, &#8220;Well, my contributions don&#8217;t matter much, so
I&#8217;ll skimp on quality and quantity. Work of other people will
hide my lack of enthusiasm for the job.&#8221; You&#8217;ve landed on a
slippery slope, and you bet it&#8217;s downhill from here on. The
problem is that other people, those that you hoped to rely on,
might think the same thing. Suddenly, instead of making a lot
of right decisions, thousands of people are making a lot of
bad decisions&#8212;a sure path to a&nbsp;catastrophe.</p>
<p>Both your boss and you need to figure out how your work fits
into a bigger picture. He or she needs to provide context and
set a goal. It&#8217;s up to you to look around, see what other
teams are doing, and watch where your industry is heading. You
shouldn&#8217;t make your job your meaning of life&#8212;unless you want
to&#8212;but you should know how your work contributes to the
whole. Even if you have a job you don&#8217;t like and have to do to
make ends meet, <a href="/blog/love-what-you-do-quotes.html">changing your perspective and finding out why
that work is important</a> will make it easier for you and
better for the&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>Finding a purpose in your work is critical. You might be a cog
in a machine, but you should be a cog that is enabling the
machine to function&nbsp;properly.</p>
