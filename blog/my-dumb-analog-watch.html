<p>Media is full of wearables these days. And that&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span>. We&#8217;re
doing social and technology experiments of which some will
fail and some will succeed. Our lives are going to be
integrated with technology even more in the future, in one way
or another; it&#8217;s inevitable. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not going to write
about Android Wear, Apple Watch, Pebble or some other gadget.
I will write about my dumb analog watch. And it&#8217;s going to be
subjective and personal, so be&nbsp;prepared.</p>
<p>Most people had dumped their watches when they started
carrying mobile phones years ago. And it makes perfect sense
for majority of people. So why do I insist on wearing one? I&#8217;m
very punctual and knowing the exact time is very important to
me; it&#8217;s easier, quicker and more socially acceptable to use a
watch for that purpose than a phone. I&#8217;ve also worn it since I
was a very, very young, so it&#8217;s a habit, not denying it. But
the biggest reason why I really love my watch is that I have
it for six years now and I&#8217;ve never changed the battery and
never corrected its time. Yes, six years without intervention
and that&#8217;s almost since the first iPhone was&nbsp;unveiled.</p>
<p>The watch has solar cells so it recharges automatically when
I&#8217;m outside and receives a radio signal every night if I&#8217;m in
Europe, <span class="caps">USA</span> or Japan, which sets it to the correct time. I
don&#8217;t have to think about it&#8212;it just works. In that regard
it&#8217;s really a rare piece of&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>Every other modern wrist gadget provides a lot of distractions
and/or requires a lot of attention, either daily recharging or
some other device that enables it to function properly. They
are almost like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a> and we all know how that&nbsp;ended.</p>
<p>The real estate on my wrist is scarce. For something else to
replace my dumb watch, it has to match current functionality,
at least to a point, and then add some extra value. There will
come a time when this will be true. But not&nbsp;yet.</p></div>
