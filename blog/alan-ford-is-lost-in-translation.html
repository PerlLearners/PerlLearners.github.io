<p><em>Alan Ford</em> is a comic series started at the end of 1960s.
Alan is a member of a small group of mostly clumsy and lazy
secret agents operating from a flower shop in New York. Their
actions are filled with satire and black humor often pointing
to issues in Western&nbsp;society.</p>
<p>This introduction would be redundant if you&#8217;re from a former
Yugoslavia country. Just saying <em>Alan Ford</em> would be enough
to set a stage for either a discussion or a joke. And this is
where I&nbsp;stumbled.</p>
<p>The comic was extremely popular in Croatia for decades. My
generation and my parents&#8217; generation read it. Even if someone
didn&#8217;t, they probably knew it existed and some main
characters. It&#8217;s a common reference both in everyday speech
and in media. It&#8217;s so pervasive that I took it for granted.
And I mean, why wouldn&#8217;t I? I was still a kid, all grown-ups
knew about it and the story unfolded in the <span class="caps">US</span>. In that
pre-Internet time this meant it was as known as Star Wars.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6lW1FbSHXA">What a mistaka to&nbsp;maka.</a></p>
<p>My narrow-minded perspective got obliterated <a href="/blog/over-the-alps.html">when I left
Croatia</a>. Frequent references during conversations to
either <em>Alan Ford</em> characters or situations were all met with
blank stares. I attributed the first couple of misses to
chance, but afterwards I started to worry. Even when I tried
to explain, they didn&#8217;t get it because the required context is
huge. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t them, maybe it was&nbsp;me? </p>
<p>A quick search provided all the answers I needed, but didn&#8217;t
really want to hear. The comic was only popular in
Italy&#8212;where it originated&#8212;and former Yugoslavia. There were
attempts to expand to other countries, but they all&nbsp;failed.</p>
<p>That got me thinking on how many seemingly unrelated things
are subtle ingredients of a popular culture. One thing by
itself may not be noticeable, but a lot of them added together
represent a big chunk of common knowledge and context which
everyone can reference. It becomes a part of country&#8217;s
culture. When you go away, it&#8217;s almost impossible to take it
with you. It&#8217;s also hard to learn intricacies of other
countries and cultures; not because someone wants to hide them
from you, but because they are often not aware of them&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>Using <em>Alan Ford</em> in everyday speech was living in a bubble.
But it was a fun bubble and I miss&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Translation for non-Croatian&nbsp;speakers:  </p>
<p>Parrot: <em>&#8220;Why are you so angry? You can buy a hundred cameras
with the amount she gave you.&#8221;</em><br />
Old man: <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of principle. It&#8217;s not fair to steal
something and then have it stolen from&nbsp;you.&#8221;</em></p>
