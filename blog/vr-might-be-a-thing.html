<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I was skeptical about the new virtual reality (<span class="caps">VR</span>) hype. It
was the skepticism of the worst kind&#8212;the one out of
ignorance. My first intro to <span class="caps">VR</span> were some of the first demos
on Google&#8217;s Cardboard when it was released in mid-2014. The
experience was novel, but not at all breathtaking: graphics
were rudimentary, you had to hold the handset with your hands,
and the lenses distorted the image just enough to give you a
headache. &#8220;Cute toy,&#8221; I told&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>Fast forward two and a half years. I&#8217;m walking away from an
hour long testing of <span class="caps">HTC</span> Vive and Google&#8217;s Daydream headsets.
The only thing I can think about is, &#8220;<span class="caps">VR</span> might be a thing.&#8221;
There are three reasons why this experience was vastly
different from the previous&nbsp;one:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to use your hands with a controller and
   interact with the virtual&nbsp;world</li>
<li>The ability to move around (<span class="caps">HTC</span>&nbsp;Vive)</li>
<li>Better graphics (though still far from&nbsp;perfect)</li>
</ol>
<p>Before, I was painfully aware that I&#8217;m testing a prototype.
Now, I&#8217;m not testing anything, I&#8217;m in a different world.
Opportunities in education and entertainment are&nbsp;endless.</p>
<p>That being said, we still have a long way to go. Headsets,
both dedicated and high-end smartphones, are too expensive for
the majority of people. There isn&#8217;t enough content yet.
Technology and platforms are in development and who knows how
interoperability will work out, if at all. Virtual reality
might not go mainstream for many reasons, but I&#8217;m finally
convinced that it has a&nbsp;chance.</p></div>
