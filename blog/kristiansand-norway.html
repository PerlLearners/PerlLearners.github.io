<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Last week I was in Kristiansand for a few days. It&#8217;s a small
town on the southernmost tip of Norway. It has sandy beaches
(Christian&#8217;s <em>sand</em>, got it?:) and it&#8217;s a popular summer
destination for people in the region. The beginning of
January, temperatures around freezing and (too) long nights
didn&#8217;t really seem inviting, but that&#8217;s one more reason to
come back during summer&nbsp;months.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2013-01-17_kristiansand_night.jpg" alt="Kristiansand during the night." /></p>
<p>The first thing you notice when you come to Norway is that it&#8217;s
expensive; it&#8217;s probably one of the most expensive places to
live in. On the other hand, with their earnings, going anywhere
else is like going on a shopping spree. Ordering a small pizza
in an average fast food restaurant will cost you <span class="caps">NOK</span> 140 which
is about 140 kunas or 19 euros. A great way to stay&nbsp;slim.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2013-01-17_kristiansand_houses.jpg" alt="A row of houses just by the sea." /></p>
<p>Norwegians are, by their own words, pretty closed and not very
social (unless there&#8217;s alcohol involved), entitled to big
salaries and many benefits, and generally relaxed and not in a
hurry. One of the things supporting that lifestyle is the fact
their future is secured for the next 50 years. They have huge
reserves of oil and other natural resource. They didn&#8217;t feel
the global recession at all and it&#8217;s all roses to them. But
the oil won&#8217;t last forever so I&#8217;m hoping they are investing
that intelligently (this must sound ironic coming from a guy
from a country that&#8217;s one foot in the&nbsp;grave).</p>
<p>Kristiansand has major shipbuilding and repair facilities that
support Norway&#8217;s oil industry so a big part of the town is an
industrial harbor. Docks, cranes, containers and a railway are
a contrast to the old historical center, sandy beaches and
summer&nbsp;houses.</p>

<p>Scandinavians are known for their love of nature, so a park, a
lake or even a bigger forest is never too far. It&#8217;s a great
way to take a walk and lose yourself in your&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
