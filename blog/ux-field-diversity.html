<p><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/">Susan Farrell and Jakob Nielsen</a> have made a survey
of <span class="caps">UX</span> professionals&#8217; careers followed by the analysis &#8212;
<a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-career-advice/">&#8220;User Experience Career Advice&#8221;</a>. I&#8217;ve quoted a few
snippets I found surprising or very&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strongest finding from this research is that there is no
single defining characteristic of user experience careers.
For each of the main points we considered, our respondents
provided an immense diversity of&nbsp;answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- separate Markdown blockquotes -->

<blockquote>
<p>On a more detailed level, when we asked about specific
activities such as making wireframes, gathering
requirements, or running usability studies, it was also
striking how diverse <span class="caps">UX</span> professionals&#8217; jobs are. Fully 75%
of respondents said that they perform at least 16 different
<span class="caps">UX</span>&nbsp;activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense, especially in small teams where one person
has to cover a lot of ground. A need for a lot of knowledge
and experience is making it challenging, especially because
there are not a lot of dedicated educational institutions that
can help at the moment. That&#8217;s why people are entering user
experience field from diverse&nbsp;areas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s no single degree to define the field: design,
psychology, and communication were the most common major
areas, sharply pursued by English and computer science. All
of these fields make some sense as a partial educational
background for <span class="caps">UX</span> professionals, but together those five
disciplines accounted for only 45% of bachelor&#8217;s&nbsp;degrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- separate Markdown blockquotes -->

<blockquote>
<p>Digging deeper than the title on the diploma, we asked
people which of the subjects that they studied had actually
turned out to be useful. Continuing the diversity theme,
there were lots of different things that <span class="caps">UX</span> pros claim to
find useful. The top scores in order of usefulness were web
design, writing, programming, psychology, design, and
research methods. Any list where programming and psychology
are next to each other is clearly indicative of an
interdisciplinary&nbsp;field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in starting or transfering to a <span class="caps">UX</span>
career, be sure to read the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-career-advice/">analysis</a> or even the the whole
<a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/user-experience-careers/">report</a> if you like details and helpful&nbsp;hints.</p></div>
