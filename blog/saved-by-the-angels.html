<p>The planned layover in Frankfurt is one and a half hour.
That&#8217;s really comfortable. But when my plane is late 35
minutes on arrival, the shuttle bus gets stuck 10 minutes in
traffic and I get dumped on a wrong terminal, some very
worrying thoughts go through my head while I&#8217;m running around.
The new shuttle bus is quickly dispatched getting me closer to
my&nbsp;destination.</p>
<p>But then, one hundred Chinese are waiting in front of me for
passport control. It&#8217;s the Great Wall of China! Luckily, I
kindly ask them if I can get to the front of the line because
my flight is due in 10 minutes and they say &#8220;yes&#8221;. I bow and
run&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>As an aside, before that I asked a big white German guy
working there if he could help me. He asked me if I had an <span class="caps">EU</span>
passport. I said &#8220;no&#8221;. He shrugged his shoulders and told me
to stand in line. It seems that by not being an <span class="caps">EU</span> citizen I&#8217;m
worth as much as a baggage&nbsp;trolley.</p>
<p>A bit more running, a security check and I&#8217;m the last one
going through the gate. The guy at the counter told me he was
just closing it. That was&nbsp;close.</p>
<p>Two hours later I&#8217;m trying to find a free seat at the packed
Copenhagen airport waiting for my next flight. I spot one, sit
down and close my eyes. I&#8217;m trying to relax from the whole
mess and think who should I thank for getting on time. I open
my eyes and see this&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2013-01-27_victorias_secret.jpg" alt="Victoria's Secret store in Copenhagen airport." /></p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not the sign from the heavens, I don&#8217;t know what is&nbsp;:)</p>
<p><span class="caps">P.S.</span> The big display in the back of the store was playing the
&#8220;Angels in Bloom&#8221; fashion show. And you know what? The Angels
walking down the line is very&nbsp;relaxing.</p></div>
