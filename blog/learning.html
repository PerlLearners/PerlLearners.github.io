<p>There are too many skills to learn in one lifetime, so
deciding where to focus and for how long is an important skill
in itself. I&#8217;ve started the process of learning many times and
I&#8217;ve built a thinking framework for determining what to learn
next and how. I&#8217;ve written the framework down so you can use
it to decide your next&nbsp;step.</p>
<h2>Create a&nbsp;list</h2>
<p>You can get a comprehensive list of skills you want or need to
improve by asking yourself three&nbsp;questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What skills interest&nbsp;me?</li>
<li>What skills could help me in my daily&nbsp;life?</li>
<li>What skills could help me in my&nbsp;job?</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s important to write the answers down. Spend an hour or two
prioritizing and scoring them in any way that you see fit, but
don&#8217;t overthink it. Maybe you have more time and want to
indulge in something personal that was neglected for a while,
or you might focus on your career. Again, there is no right
answer, but be intentional. You have to be able to verbalize
why you&#8217;ve put something on the&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>Here are my personal examples. When I was studying fifteen
years ago, I wanted to learn how to navigate with a map and a
compass. I bought books, browsed the Internet endlessly, and
spent considerable time practicing outdoors. It was, and still
is, incredibly fun. Did it help me in my daily life? Not
really. Did it help me in my job? Nope. Would I do it again?
Absolutely. Today, when I don&#8217;t have as much free time, I try
to work on skills that answer at least two questions, ideally
all three. Writing is one such skill. It&#8217;s interesting, helps
me clarify my thoughts, and is critical to my&nbsp;job.</p>
<h2>Old or&nbsp;new</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a good chance your list has more items than you can
realistically work on. A good way to narrow the list down is
to try to estimate the amount of effort you need to put in and
the potential outcome. You can estimate by knowing a bit about
learning curves and asking yourself, &#8220;do I improve an existing
skill or do I start something&nbsp;new?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2017-05-06_learning_curves.svg" alt="A chart with different learning curves over time." /></p>
<p>The chart above shows an approximation of learning curves when
you apply a constant effort. It makes intuitive sense&#8212;if you
don&#8217;t work on a skill, it will stagnate or decline. Even
though the curves are different, they have something in
common: with every additional unit of time you improve less
and&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>Take driving a car as an example. Let&#8217;s assume it takes 1 year
to reach 40% proficiency (normal driving in traffic under most
weather conditions) and 3 years to reach 80% (you can
participate in car races, perform basic tricks with a car, and
have no problems driving safely in all weather conditions).
Just as a reminder, this assumes constant effort where you
take your car every day to a parking lot, empty road, or a
track to practice. Most people stop improving when they feel
safe driving in urban traffic and then stay at that level&nbsp;forever.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2017-05-06_example_driving.svg" alt="A learning curve that reaches 40% of the level in one year
and 80% of the level in three years." /></p>
<p>In addition to driving a car, let&#8217;s assume two other skills
have the same progression: maintaining a car and riding a
bicycle. Two outcomes are interesting to&nbsp;compare:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dedicate all years to improving driving a car (chart
   situation&nbsp;A)</li>
<li>Dedicate 1 year to each skill (chart situation&nbsp;B)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/media/external/2017-05-06_dedicate.svg" alt="Situation A - devote more time to one skill.
 Situation B - split time between more skills." /></p>
<p>The first outcome conveys passion for racing fast cars or
working in a movie industry as a stunt man. The second one,
with related skills that augment each other, provides
excellent mobility in urban environments while keeping costs
low. Both options are good, but one is better if you know what
you&#8217;re aiming&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>We are back to the question from the beginning: do you
continue improving an existing skill or do you start something
new? Are you a pianist striving to be the best in the world?
Or do you, as an engineer, want to take on more responsibility
by leading a team, where new skills like coaching,
communication, and giving presentations improve your chances
of&nbsp;success?</p>
<h2>How to&nbsp;learn</h2>
<p>You need two things to learn a skill: theory and practice.
They are two sides of the same coin. The ratio of theory and
practice varies depending on the skill you&#8217;re learning and
your current level. To start driving a car, you need minimal
theoretical knowledge, but a bit more practice. On the other
hand, many skills in medicine require extensive theoretical
knowledge before doing&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Where I see most people fail is working on the first
part&#8212;going to lectures, talking to experts, watching online
videos, or reading books&#8212;and then never trying to apply that
knowledge. Nobody expects they can drive a car after watching
an online video, but somehow people expect that for many other
skills. You need to&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>Deliberate practice is a structured way to improve a skill and
consists of four&nbsp;steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break down a skill to manageable&nbsp;steps</li>
<li>Set time aside for&nbsp;practice</li>
<li>Pick a specific goal for a practice&nbsp;session</li>
<li>Get feedback and&nbsp;adjust</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Break down a skill to manageable&nbsp;steps</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never driven a car before, getting into one with a
goal to pick up someone at the airport during a blizzard is an
excellent way to fail. The task is too complex and out of
reach. The first goal of driving should be getting into a car
in a safe environment, pressing the clutch, putting it into
first gear, slowly releasing brakes, and getting the car to
move slowly. A beginner can manage&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Deconstructing a skill is the hardest of all four steps. Many
skills were taken apart a long time ago, and you just have to
follow instructions up to a certain level. For example,
driving a car with an instructor or learning to play an
instrument follow a clear progression. But what about
leadership or communication? What is your first step if you
want to improve them? It&#8217;s not as&nbsp;obvious.</p>
<h2>2. Set time aside for&nbsp;practice</h2>
<p>I attended a company course last year. The instructors have
been giving it for years, and they shared some insights into
how previous participants performed after the course. One
common attitude among participants is, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just absorb
everything from the workshop and then use it in my regular
job.&#8221; It turns out that doesn&#8217;t work. When deadlines loom and
stress builds up, everyone gets back to their old behavior
just to get by. You need to dedicate time to&nbsp;practice.</p>
<h2>3. Pick a specific goal for a practice&nbsp;session</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve set an hour aside for piano. What do you do? If you
don&#8217;t have a specific goal that pushes you to your limits,
it&#8217;s not deliberate practice; it&#8217;s just playing piano for fun.
Picking a goal is easier if a skill is deconstructed&nbsp;well.</p>
<h2>4. Get feedback and&nbsp;adjust</h2>
<p>You have to know how you&#8217;re doing at all times. If it&#8217;s too
easy, you&#8217;re ready for the next step. If it&#8217;s too hard, slow
down a bit, ask for guidance, or revisit some of the previous&nbsp;exercises. </p>
<p>You can get feedback in many&nbsp;ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate and direct. You can always see, smell, hear, or
  taste the food you&#8217;re&nbsp;cooking.</li>
<li>From someone. It&#8217;s hard to examine your posture or movement
  when doing sports, so having a spotter&nbsp;helps.</li>
<li>Testing. Learning math and not sure you understand
  everything? Take a test. Even though many people hated tests
  in school, recent research indicates that frequent testing
  improves&nbsp;learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask others for&nbsp;help</h2>
<p>Coaches, teachers, and mentors provide guidance and feedback,
which is precisely what you need for deliberate practice.
Don&#8217;t necessarily look for people who are on top of their
field, especially if you&#8217;re just starting out; anyone who is
more skillful than you will do the job if you know how to ask
the right&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>Some teaching relationships come naturally or as a part of
common training curriculum: tennis coaches, guitar teachers,
and foreign language instructors. However, that relationship
is not clearly defined in many work environments, especially
in companies that don&#8217;t have resources, knowledge, or
motivation to educate their employees. It&#8217;s up to you to find
mentors who can help you&nbsp;learn.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle in finding a mentor is not asking. We
sometimes never think of asking and sometimes it&#8217;s just the
fear of it. To help you get over the fear, imagine you know a
topic well and someone comes to you for help. Will you say
&#8220;no&#8221; if you have enough time? I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ll be happy to&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>Mentorships come in two forms: informal and formal. An
informal mentorship forms when you spend time with a person
who is willing to give you tips and feedback, but there is no
plan or structure to it. Working next to an experienced
colleague who is always ready to answer your questions in the
first few months on a job is an example of an informal
mentorship. On the other hand, you have to be more intentional
for a formal mentorship. If you notice a person&#8212;inside or
outside of your company&#8212;who could help you improve, reach out
to them and ask. It&#8217;s useful to write a short document
outlining what would you like to learn, how often should you
meet, and when the mentoring ends. Writing just four or five
sentences down clarifies your goals and sets expectations. If
a mentor is reluctant to accept, defining an end date gives
the impression that you didn&#8217;t plan for this to go on forever,
and if the mentoring works out for both of you, you can always&nbsp;extend.</p>
<p>I started a few formal mentorships in the last few years. My
only regret is that I didn&#8217;t start them&nbsp;earlier.</p>
<h2>Teach</h2>
<p>Teaching is not a required step in learning, but is valuable
in many ways. You might have learned something informally over
the years and haven&#8217;t followed a strict process, so
deconstructing a skill for others could reveal gaps in your
understanding. In addition to that, you&#8217;ll get a lot of
questions that test your knowledge. You&#8217;ll be able to answer
many, but some might challenge you, and those will open new
learning&nbsp;opportunities.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t learn anything new from teaching&#8212;which is
highly unlikely&#8212;the satisfaction of seeing your students
acquire and use new skills is extremely&nbsp;satisfying.</p>
