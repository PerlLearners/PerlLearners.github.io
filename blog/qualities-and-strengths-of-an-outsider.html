<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I celebrated my second anniversary at Google the other day.
The question often comes to mind on what do I, a person from a
developing country in Eastern Europe, really bring to the
table. Many people working here come from top universities,
win programming competitions, speak three languages fluently, 
were running successful start-ups and got acquired, wield an
incredible talent, or have world-renowned companies in their
CVs. I can&#8217;t relate to any of these, so I always wonder how I
got in and whether I&#8217;ll be caught as an&nbsp;impostor.</p>
<p>Living in the Western world provides access to opportunities,
experienced mentors, and information. You could argue that
Internet levels the playing field for information access, but
there are infrastructural and linguistic barriers that hinder
the access that I&#8217;ll talk about a bit&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>To my delight, I found an answer to the opening quandry.
There are qualities people from less well-off countries are
uniquely positioned to develop and grow: tenacity,
resourcefulness, empathy, humility,&nbsp;diversity.</p>
<p>Let me try to give an example for&nbsp;each. </p>
<p><em>Note: I understand that I write this as a young white male
with a college degree and that, due to a combination of
historic, cultural, and social circumstances, makes me
privileged in today&#8217;s world. I won&#8217;t feel or experience
hurdles that people in different situations or with different
backgrounds might. That being said, everyone compares
themselves to people around them, so this is, for better or
worse, something that&#8217;s going through my head right&nbsp;now.</em></p>
<h2>Tenacity and&nbsp;resourcefulness</h2>
<p>In Croatia, technology always lagged a bit behind the West.
It&#8217;s not a rich country and most people have to cope with
less. Sometimes it&#8217;s an older machine or a slow Internet
connection. And while most of today&#8217;s popular consumer
technology is built in a technologically advanced <span class="caps">US</span> West
Coast bubble, it is consumed in less favorable places  with
slower connections, worse infrastructure, and lacking&nbsp;services. </p>
<p>But we consumers somehow go around limitations and find
solutions to problems. The solutions are often hacky and
crude, but most of the time they work. That constant struggle
can wear you out or it can build tenacity and&nbsp;resourcefulness.</p>
<p>One interesting example was covered by <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikipedia-zero-facebook-free-basics-angola-pirates-zero-rating">Vice</a>&nbsp;recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wikimedia and Facebook have given Angolans free access to
their websites, but not to the rest of the internet. So,
naturally, Angolans have started hiding pirated movies and
music in Wikipedia articles and linking to them on closed
Facebook groups, creating a totally free and clandestine
file sharing network in a country where mobile internet data
is extremely&nbsp;expensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Illegally pirating movies aside, it shows creative solutions
in face of overwhelming&nbsp;odds.</p>
<h2>Empathy</h2>
<p>Access to information is always limited due to language. Many
native speakers of English, Spanish, French, and other
widespread languages often take it for granted, but if you
speak something that is only understood by less than 1% of the
world&#8217;s population, you have to learn another better-known
language if you want to expand your horizons. My current life
situation wouldn&#8217;t be possible without understanding English
and it was like that long before I moved&nbsp;abroad.</p>
<p>While people of widespread languages might rationally know
that there are other languages in this world, they don&#8217;t
really feel it. And why should they? Majority of people will
understand them and all new information and knowledge is
usually generated in their&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this has unintended consequences. If you&#8217;re
using global online services, of which many have been created
in the West, only letters from the English alphabet are
allowed, and sometimes Spanish or German. I received an offer
from a huge international company boasting that it &#8220;gives me
access to nine trusted brands in nearly 100 countries&#8221;, but
that sure doesn&#8217;t seem like so if they can&#8217;t spell my name and
business address&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2016-04-15_mailing_address.jpg" alt="A mailing address is not spelled correctly." /></p>
<p>The same is true of this online bookstore that bills and ships&nbsp;internationally.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2016-04-15_shipping_address.png" alt="A shipping address is not spelled correctly." /></p>
<p>People from &#8220;minority languages&#8221; won&#8217;t make this mistake so
easily. Their names have been tampered with too many&nbsp;times.</p>
<h2>Humility</h2>
<p>Trains, trams, and buses in Switzerland are renown to be on
time, but it happens they&#8217;re a couple of minutes late
sometimes. It&#8217;s always announced up-front and the delay is
displayed on a&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>Even then I&#8217;ve heard people complain how bad those delays are.
I&#8217;m sure they either forgot or never experienced how bad it
can get. Imagine coming to a station, no screen with waiting
times and standing there beyond a reasonable amount of time
any transport should have come. Waiting and not knowing when
you&#8217;ll get to your destination. This was my Croatian reality
for years, but even that is light years ahead of what I&#8217;ve
heard from friends who visited or lived in India and some
African countries. Or imagine the worst case scenario: not
having access to public transport at all. In contrast to that,
occasional short delays are not really a&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>I remember visiting modern countries, like the <span class="caps">US</span> or Finland,
for the first time. I was impressed by many things, but never
jealous. It just demonstrated the situation back home can be
improved. Now, when I live in Switzerland, I try to be
thankful of the situation here. Living in a golden bubble can
lead to a feeling of entitlement. Having experienced worse
conditions makes cultivating humility much&nbsp;easier.</p>
<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>A different way of thinking is the greatest asset you have.
This is something that I&#8217;ve experienced personally&#8212;people in
my wider team come from different cultures on six continents
(nobody from Antarctica, yet). Scott Page, a professor of
political science and economics at the University of Michigan,
analyzed how diversity in teams produces organizational&nbsp;strength.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People from different backgrounds have varying ways of
looking at problems, what I call &#8220;tools.&#8221; The sum of these
tools is far more powerful in organizations with diversity
than in ones where everyone has gone to the same schools,
been trained in the same mold and thinks in almost identical&nbsp;ways.</p>
<p>The problems we face in the world are very complicated. Any
one of us can get stuck. If we&#8217;re in an organization where
everyone thinks in the same way, everyone will get stuck in
the same&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>But if we have people with diverse tools, they&#8217;ll get stuck
in different places. One person can do their best, and then
someone else can come in and improve on it. There&#8217;s a lot of
empirical data to show that diverse cities are more
productive, diverse boards of directors make better
decisions, the most innovative companies are&nbsp;diverse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I want to argue that diversity – defined as differences in
how we see the world, how we think about the world, how we
try and solve problems, the analogies we use, the metaphors,
the tools we acquire, the life experiences we have – make us
better at what we do,&#8221; he said. [&#8230;] Page said studies
looking at authors of research papers and patents show
similar results. For instance, the chance of writing a
successful paper, defined as one that receives more than 100
citations, increases more than fourfold if it&#8217;s co-authored.
However, Page said, it&#8217;s not the number of authors that
counts, but the different ideas they bring to the table.
Co-authors of similar ethnic groups received fewer
citations, while co-authors from different universities had
more, according to&nbsp;Page.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/diversity-leads-stronger-outcomes-says-lecturer">Cornell&nbsp;News</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his book The Signal and the Noise statistician Nate Silver
says basically the same thing&#8212;diverse models and ways of
thinking improve predictions. The caveat is that it has to be
used correctly; diversity amplifies an outcome and it can go
both&nbsp;ways.</p>
<h2>Play the long&nbsp;game</h2>
<p>The examples I mentioned are not the only ones, but they show
that even if you have a non-ideal background, you still have a
lot to offer. Yes, access to opportunities and knowledge
gives a head start, but knowing your strengths allows you to
play to them. If you&#8217;re playing the long game, your attitude
and character will always prevail over skills you have at the&nbsp;moment.</p></div>
