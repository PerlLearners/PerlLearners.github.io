<p>I finished a book <em><a href="http://sc.arcity.co/">Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So
Much</a></em> by Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir. The
premise of their research is that experiencing any kind of
scarcity negatively affects our lives and communities. While
this seems intuitive, it touches so many organizational
situations and human conditions that I was left genuinely&nbsp;surprised.</p>
<h2>What is&nbsp;scarcity</h2>
<p>Being short on money is what immediately comes to mind. It&#8217;s
a very common one, but far from the only type of&nbsp;scarcity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dieters have to constantly watch over a limited number of&nbsp;calories.</li>
<li>Constant noise and interruptions make concentration and
  focus scarce. Think noisy offices and gadget&nbsp;notifications.</li>
<li>Lonely people are missing affection and&nbsp;attention.</li>
<li>Sleep&nbsp;deprivation.</li>
<li>Busy people are struggling to find more time, but never seem
  to&nbsp;succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The consequences of scarcity are really&nbsp;disturbing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; a school in New Haven was located next to a noisy
railroad line. To measure the impact of this noise on
academic performance, two researchers noted that only one
side of the school faced the tracks, so the students in
classrooms on that side were particularly exposed to the
noise but were otherwise similar to their fellow students.
They found a striking difference between the two sides of
the school. Sixth graders on the train side were a full year
behind their counterparts on the quieter side. Further
evidence came when the city, prompted by this study,
installed noise pads. The researchers found that this erased
the difference: now students on both sides of the building
performed at the same level. A whole host of subsequent
studies have shown that noise can hurt concentration and
performance. Even if the impact of noise does not surprise
you, the size of the impact (a full school year level at
sixth grade)&nbsp;should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We found that farmers performed much worse before harvest
than after harvest. The same farmer fared worse on fluid
intelligence and executive control when he was poor
(preharvest) than when he was rich&nbsp;(postharvest).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Dieters, when doing anything, should find they have fewer
mental resources because they are partly preoccupied with&nbsp;food.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Scarcity doesn&#8217;t just lead us to overborrow or to fail to
invest. It leaves us handicapped in other aspects of our
lives. It makes us dumber. It makes us more impulsive. We
must get by with less mind available, with less fluid
intelligence and with diminished executive control—making
life that much&nbsp;harder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To use authors&#8217; wording, poor people are not necessarily poor
because they&#8217;re dumb, but they can be dumb because they&#8217;re
poor. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle that makes it very hard to&nbsp;escape.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t happen only to &#8220;other&#8221; people; it can happen to
everyone and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so dangerous. Researchers took a
group and randomly split it in two. Some people were assigned
to poor and others to rich participants. &#8220;The poor&#8221; showed
behavior described here and &#8220;the rich&#8221; prospered, even though
all were in the same socio-economic situation hours&nbsp;earlier.</p>
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>Handling scarcity is much easier if a person has slack. Slack
can be a lot of different&nbsp;things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rainy day fund in a&nbsp;bank.</li>
<li>Allowing more time between travel segments or business&nbsp;meetings.</li>
<li>A busy executive having an assistant on-call to help with
  unexpected changes and&nbsp;interruptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slack allows us ease of mind and, unexpectedly, better
performance in the long run. If there is no slack and scarcity
is not self-imposed, it becomes&nbsp;poverty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dieters can take a break from their diet. The busy can take
vacations. One cannot take a vacation from poverty. Simply
deciding not to be poor&#8212;even for a bit&#8212;is never an&nbsp;option.</p>
<p>This discussion clarifies what we mean by poverty. We mean
cases of economic scarcity where changing what you want, or
think you need, is simply not&nbsp;viable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a poverty example for dieters too. If a person is
suffering from a medical condition that limits what the
person can eat, it&#8217;s also not an option to&nbsp;stop.</p>
<h2>Borrowing</h2>
<p>Borrowing by itself is not bad, but the ones who need it the
most are usually not in the right frame of mind to make a good
and informed decision about&nbsp;it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, as far as personality traits go these people are
anything but myopic; rather, it is the context of scarcity
that makes us all act that way. Tunnels limit everyone&#8217;s&nbsp;vision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to make matters worse, humans in general are terrible at
valuation over long periods of time. We overvalue immediate
benefits at the expense of future ones: this is why it&#8217;s hard
to save, to got to the gym or do your school assignments&nbsp;early.</p>
<p>The book provides more examples of borrowing money and adverse
consequences of it, but another issue grabbed my attention.
It&#8217;s probably one of the biggest problems in our
industry&#8212;technical&nbsp;debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When working to finish things quickly, the engineers tunneled.
Inside their tunnel, a quick fix was just the thing needed.
Cutting corners was the perfect solution; the cost would only
show up later. Much like an expensive loan, a hastily patched
solution looks attractive within the tunnel. It saves us
something today even as it creates greater expenses in the&nbsp;future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This often happens because resources were poorly&nbsp;allocated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As one manager puts it: &#8220;If you look at our resource
allocation on traditional projects, we always start late and
don&#8217;t put people on the projects soon enough … then we load
as many people on as it takes … the resource allocation
peaks when we launch the project.&#8221; Based on their years of
study, the researchers conclude, &#8220;There are few images more
common in current discussions of R&amp;D management than that of
the overworked engineering team putting in long hours to
complete a project in its last days before launch.&#8221;
Firefighting does not just lead to errors; it leads to a
very predictable kind of error: important but non urgent
tasks are&nbsp;neglected.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Is all hope&nbsp;lost?</h2>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not. Dissecting and understanding a problem is the
first step in solving it. The authors provide some ideas and
directions how their findings can help with organizational and
global issues. Most of them would be categorized as common
sense, but they often have a twist that makes them really&nbsp;effective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the following thought experiment. In an attempt to
curb predatory lending, one state forces payday lenders to
charge lower fees—say, $25 instead of $50 on a $200 loan.
Assume the industry remains profitable and survives. In
another state, a different program is created: fees remain at
$50, but only $25 goes to the lender; the remaining $25 goes
into an account in the borrower&#8217;s name. Once $200 has been
accumulated in this account—in this case, after eight
loans—the person no longer needs to borrow. When she needs a
loan, she can use these savings instead. In effect, by saving
$25 of every $50 they would have paid for fees, the borrowers
can quickly become &#8220;lenders to&nbsp;themselves.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book goes a bit too far to portray everything as a
scarcity problem in my opinion. These problems influence
everyone at some point, but character also plays a role in how
strong this effect will be. Nevertheless, I recommend it to
everyone interested in human behavior, especially to designers
and managers. Being reminded once again that people make bad
decisions, not only because of their flawed characters, but
also because of circumstance, is a powerful tool in building
humane products and&nbsp;services.</p></div>
