<p>I was fortunate to spend a recent <a href="/blog/maldives.html">vacation on
Maldives</a>. Sandy beaches in warm
lagoons were a welcome escape from cold European winter, but
it was impossible to run away from modern life. Let me
tell you about two things that dominated my exploration of
local settlements: technology and&nbsp;politics.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Some info about&nbsp;Maldives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in 26
  atolls. About 200 islands are used for living and industry,
  and 100 for tourist resorts. 99% of the country is&nbsp;water.</li>
<li>The highest point is only 2.4 meters above sea level,
  average 1.5 meters. Global warming and rising sea levels are
  a real threat to&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>There are only around 390,000 people living in Maldives and
  almost all of them are Muslim. Nudity is illegal and women
  have to cover themselves in public. It&#8217;s a big problem
  because they live off tourism and tourists want to get
  tanned. So they are pragmatic about it and allow women
  tourists to wear swim suites, but only inside&nbsp;resorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll be frank. Except for the covering part, which was brought
up by my wife during planning, everything else I learned from
a flight magazine. I knew I would lie on a speckle of sand in
the middle of Indian ocean, but other than that I only had my
assumptions about how it would look like. Picture Christopher
Columbus disembarking at the shores of America and you
wouldn&#8217;t be too&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>And so I exited the plane, entered the arrivals building,
stepped in a line for passport control and looked around:
other tourists, customs officials, an ad for a 4G network, an
old conveyor &#8230; Wait, what? 4G? I wasn&#8217;t expecting to get a
phone signal in all places; instead I&#8217;m looking at a telecom
message about a high speed data connection. On a sand heap.
In the middle of an&nbsp;ocean.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2015-02-24_sudden_realization.jpg" alt="A surprised cat with a text - this changes everything." /></p>
<p>And then I started noticing smartphones: small and big, old
and new. It seemed like everyone had one. The trend continued
for over a week&#8212;cooks and drivers in the resort used them, as
did the locals in villages we visited at one point. Security
guards and check-in personnel fumbled with them when they were
bored. In hindsight, I was dumb to assume anything different.
I&#8217;m reading a lot about &#8220;mobile only&#8221; trends in non-Western
countries, but I&#8217;ve never experienced it first-hand. It was a
distant fact and not a part of my&nbsp;life. </p>
<p>Now, seeing it with my own two eyes, I&#8217;m even more convinced
that mobile expansion is really one of the biggest
technological and social shifts in the last ten years. And
it&#8217;s still growing like&nbsp;crazy.</p>

<p>The most notable &#8220;aha&#8221; moment was when a resort employee asked
me to share some photos with him. I immediately asked for an
email because I figured that was the easiest way to do it. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t have email&#8221; came back. Oh &#8230; One more thing I took for
granted. Maybe because I can&#8217;t think of any European or
American I know personally, 20 to 50 years old, who doesn&#8217;t
have an&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>I read a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/13/china-web-design-trends-2015/">Smashing Magazine article</a> the other day about
web design in China. It was mostly mobile oriented and I&#8217;ll
quote some trends that correlate nicely with my experience in&nbsp;Maldives:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>But everyone in the Western world has a smartphone,&#8221; you
think. You&#8217;ve got one, yeah? You probably don&#8217;t know anyone
who doesn&#8217;t, so it&#8217;s hard to imagine an increased level of
saturation or to imagine that the difference between China
usage and non-China usage could be significant. There is,
though, and I would argue that the difference is evident not
in the number of mobile users, but rather in the level of
mobile-centrism. A few statistics out there support this
theory, but they don&#8217;t encapsulate the story the way that
anecdotal evidence does, so let me offer some, based on my
own&nbsp;experience:</p>
<p>In China, your mobile phone number is nearly as important as
a social security number in the United States. If you lose
access to your mobile number, you may also irrevocably lose
access to e-commerce accounts, digital wallets, social
network accounts (which are tied directly to the mobile
number) and much more. Because of this, people take great
care to go through the process of officially associating
their number with their government-issued state <span class="caps">ID</span> to
prevent identity theft and to ensure easy retrieval in case
of <span class="caps">SIM</span> loss or&nbsp;damage.</p>
<p>Most websites in China use a mobile phone number instead of
an email address as the primary identifier for logging in
and as the primary password-recovery tool — particularly
relevant since email doesn&#8217;t have nearly the saturation in
China that it does in the&nbsp;West.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If technology interests you, read the whole article to uncover
some other non-Western&nbsp;trends.</p>
<p>Since I touched on China, there were a lot of Chinese
tourists; maybe a half of all people in the resort. I must say
it surprised me, but what surprised me even more was almost
everyone had a gold iPhone. It was clearly a status symbol for
them, especially because Apple is one of <a href="http://www.hurun.net/en/ArticleShow.aspx?nid=262">the top three luxury
brands in China</a>. I&#8217;ve noticed (too much) gold iPhones and
Androids in Istanbul on my way back too. I have to give credit
to Apple for introducing the gold line (and everyone else for
following); I couldn&#8217;t imagine why anyone would buy it, but it
looks like it had perfect business sense. Another reminder not
to design for&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>Human behavior will always be a source of inspiration and
bewilderment. There are certain behavioral patterns and
interactions, but also social and cultural constructs, that
are observable in populations of any size. Maldives is not an&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>By now you probably have a good impression of how small the
country is. But just to make it more interesting, I overlaid
the island I visited onto&nbsp;Manhattan.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2015-02-24_maps_of_islands.jpg" alt="A Maldivian island overlaid on top of Manhattan." /></p>
<p>Small, right? Just a bit bigger than Central Park and only
7,000 people live there. You would expect an oasis of peace
and tranquility. And you would be mistaken. They have two
villages and were fighting each other ferociously until very
recently (facepalm). If you put two people on a desert island,
I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll find a reason to resent each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2015-02-24_street.jpg" alt="A man walking in the street." /></p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2015-02-24_school.jpg" alt="Children in front of a school." /></p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2015-02-24_graffiti.jpg" alt="Graffiti on a wall." /></p>
<p>Everything seemed usual and familiar while walking through one
village: houses, schools, mosques, government offices, shops.
It didn&#8217;t stop there unfortunately: graffiti and political
posters and messages. So what&#8217;s going on? They are not
satisfied with the current national government, rising taxes
and upcoming reforms, so they are preparing for earlier
reelections. The most common response to a question why
something works in a specific way (or doesn&#8217;t work at
all)&#8212;&#8221;Because of&nbsp;politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;m not sure if this is a sign of a really bad
government or the human need to blame &#8220;them&#8221; for everything.
I&#8217;ve seen both before and neither option is&nbsp;good.</p>

<p>One thing that really struck me is that Maldivians, on
average, live in worse conditions than people who come there
for a vacation. Resorts are modern, luxurious and clean&#8212;trash
and dry leaves are removed daily from paths and beaches&#8212;and
local settlements often look like slums. Graffiti all over
small and usually neglected houses, trash everywhere. I&#8217;m
aware that tourism is their main source of income which allows
development in other areas, but it nevertheless makes me a bit&nbsp;sad.</p>

<p><img src="/media/external/2015-02-24_walker.jpg" alt="A man walking in the street among walls and houses." /></p>
<p>Smartphones and politics. Every new trip I undergo confirms
we&#8217;re all more alike than&nbsp;different.</p></div>
