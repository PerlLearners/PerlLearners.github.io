<p>The initial version of my new site is finally up. It took me
almost two years to finally get started. You know how it goes,
there&#8217;s always some more pressing thing to do. I found myself
with two free weekends, so I decided there would be no more&nbsp;excuses.</p>
<p>Why build this site? The question cropped up when I was
talking to some people about the idea and I often asked it
myself when I was searching for reasons to invest some time
into&nbsp;it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m a supporter of owning your own data. I have content
   elsewhere and it&#8217;s great for sharing and reach, but I
   always loved the idea of having a centralized place - a
   reference if you will. I&#8217;m planning to put my thoughts and
   projects here with links to external resources if more
   appropriate. We&#8217;ll see what happens after&nbsp;that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I needed a playground. The web is evolving super fast and
   there are so many things to learn and try out. Projects I&#8217;m
   working on often have strict deadlines and requirements, so
   compromises have to be made. With this I&#8217;m completely free
   to do whatever I want. For example, I don&#8217;t plan to support
   anything lower than Internet Explorer 9. The pain&#8217;s just
   not worth it for this kind of site. The fact this is my
   public playground gives me extra insights in how things&nbsp;work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I wanted to try out a few things here: it had
to be a clean black site, I wanted to play with typography,
build the whole site using ems, and try to build mobile and
content first responsive website. For now, only I can say it&#8217;s
hard. I knew that before, but I just want to repeat it for the
record. It had to be static pages only (no server site logic)
from the technical side, so I&#8217;m using Hyde generator to build
it. I&#8217;ll add JavaScript for dynamic stuff if need&nbsp;arises.</p>
<p>After two weekends I&#8217;m about 20% finished. There are a lot of
things that have to be automated and refactored under the
hood. And a lot more content written. But, everything in due
time. This website is open-sourced so you can look around if
you&#8217;re&nbsp;interested.</p>
