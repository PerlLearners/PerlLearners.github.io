<p>It was Tuesday, May 1st, 2012. It was a day off so I found
myself sitting at my desk at home with some time to spare. I
looked at my printer paper stack, took one out and started
doodling nothing in particular. After about twenty minutes I
had a paper full of lines, circles, three-dimensional shapes
and the lingering idea of getting better if I did this every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I was pretty good at drawing up till that moment. Or so I
assumed based on objective and valuable metrics like the fact
my parents thought I was drawing well as a kid and that I was
a favorite partner in Pictionary.  But I always try to learn
and improve, so I quickly decided what I&#8217;ll do for the next
364 days of my life. My little journey&nbsp;began.</p>
<p>I had no plan when I started, just a lot of motivation. The
problem with motivation is that it&#8217;s not a constant force, but
a big pendulum that needs a push every once in a while to keep
it running. It&#8217;s easy to sketch for a few days, weeks or even
a whole month. But when you get to day forty all ideas are
used, the sketches look awful and awfully similar, and life
doesn&#8217;t ask you if you have time to&nbsp;spare.</p>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>When unable to think of anything, I took a book about
sketching, industrial design, artistic drawing or graphic
design, and tried to give myself a theme for a week or a
month. Doing focused exercises paid off in all future
sketches. For example, after working for a few weeks on
perspective, reflections, contours, intersections and other
three-dimensional goodies from an industrial design sketching
book, it became very hard not to do it correctly. Or at least
you become aware of it and immediately start noticing if
something is out of&nbsp;order.</p>

<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2013-05-20_basics2.jpg" alt="Cubes and different shading" /></p>
<p>I mostly sketched simple shapes and inanimate objects, but as
my current work is dominantly designing mobile apps and touch
interfaces, smartphones and hands became a recurring&nbsp;theme.</p>
<p><img class="wide" src="/media/external/2013-05-20_smartphone_hand.jpg" alt="A hand holding a phone" /></p>
<p>The best way to get an idea is to draw anything that&#8217;s close
to you at the moment. Take your keys, a watch, a pencil, a
<span class="caps">USB</span> stick, and just try to copy it on paper. You can use
simple and quick gesture drawing to try out different angles
and ratios, or go into minute details of a part of that
object. Both approaches will improve your observation and
drawing skills in some&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Foul beasts called ellipses tortured me so much they deserve a
separate paragraph. All circles on a three-dimensional object
become ellipses when viewed from an angle. Drawing anything
without them is impossible. And to draw a decent freehand
ellipse of particular size and angle is difficult. They wait
quietly in an ambush. After half an hour of sketching you lay
one on the paper and it&#8217;s just a tiny bit off, but it messes
the whole perspective, and the sketch looks like a drawing of
a three-year-old. And guess what? There&#8217;s no undo.  I
dedicated whole sessions to practicing drawing ellipses only.
I think I&#8217;m getting the hang of it. In ten years I&#8217;ll be
confident I can draw them&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I always wanted to start with a perfect line
in the middle of the page. That almost never happened. What
I&#8217;ve found out is that it&#8217;s best to start doodling on the
side; it may be bad, so you can leave it and start the main
sketch, or it can lead to something good expanding it towards
the&nbsp;middle.</p>

<h2>Persistence</h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t begin to describe how important this is. Of course,
it&#8217;s <em>the most</em> important thing, but it&#8217;s also a few orders of
magnitude more so than the second or third thing on the list.
It&#8217;s easy to be persistent on a rainy weekend at home with two
hours to kill, but a bit harder when you&#8217;re at <a href="/blog/ux-london-2013.html">a conference
out of town</a> for a few days or <a href="/blog/three-days-to-sydney-part-one.html">flying for
28 hours</a>. No excuses were accepted. There were days
when I came home and crashed on my bed exhausted only to drag
myself to a desk a minute later to put some ink on the paper.
If I had a great day, I sketched. If I had a horrible day,
I sketched. <em>Every single day</em>.</p>
<p>Very few people knew what I was doing, but those who did
helped me tremendously, and I want to thank them. I would
probably slip if they didn&#8217;t watch out for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>One quote I found in the middle of my journey helped me push&nbsp;forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set yourself to practice drawing, drawing only a little each
day, so that you may not come to lose your taste for it, or
get tired of it. Do not fail, as you go on, to draw
something every day, for no matter how little it is, it will
be well worthwhile, and will do you a world of&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>&#8212; Cennino Cennini Il Libro Dell&#8217;Arte, c.&nbsp;1435</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Coming to the&nbsp;end</h2>
<p><img src="/media/external/2013-05-20_stack_of_papers.jpg" alt="A stack of papers" /></p>
<p>April 30th, 2013 was the last day of this journey. A stack of
papers grew over the year and I visibly improved. I was also
feeling a bit confused because I knew I didn&#8217;t have to do it
anymore, but the habit was formed a long time ago. Will I
continue doing it every day? Probably not, it&#8217;s too
time-consuming, and there are other things to learn. Will I
stop sketching? Hell no! Sketching is so fun and useful that
it will still be my regular activity. I always keep pen and
paper in arms&nbsp;reach.</p>
<h2>Things I learned (or confirmed once&nbsp;again)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistence trumps <a href="/blog/sketching-tools.html">tools</a>.</strong><br />
   I used the same basic pen for the first 41 sketches. At the
   beginning, I was wondering if I&#8217;m missing something out,
   but I quickly found that 41 sketches lead to better
   improvements than 6 sketches (one a week) with different
   and more expensive pens and&nbsp;markers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflecting once in a while is good.</strong><br />
   Daily improvements are too small to notice, so it&#8217;s easy to
   get into &#8220;not going anywhere&#8221; mindset. Taking a step back
   and comparing work from a few months ago will show that the
   effort pays&nbsp;off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t wait for the perfect moment.</strong><br />
   Be it a line on a paper or a decision in your&nbsp;life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
