<p>By <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">Joel Spolsky</a> from the turn of the 21st century, but
still&nbsp;relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was an Israeli paratrooper a general stopped by to
give us a little speech about strategy. In infantry battles,
he told us, there is only one strategy: Fire and Motion. You
move towards the enemy while firing your weapon. The firing
forces him to keep his head down so he can&#8217;t fire at you.
(That&#8217;s what the soldiers mean when they shout &#8220;cover me.&#8221;
It means, &#8220;fire at our enemy so he has to duck and can&#8217;t
fire at me while I run across this street, here.&#8221; It works.)
The motion allows you to conquer territory and get closer to
your enemy, where your shots are much more likely to hit
their target. If you&#8217;re not moving, the enemy gets to decide
what happens, which is not a good thing. If you&#8217;re not
firing, the enemy will fire at you, pinning you&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>I remembered this for a long time. I noticed how almost
every kind of military strategy, from air force dogfights to
large scale naval maneuvers, is based on the idea of Fire
and Motion. It took me another fifteen years to realize that
the principle of Fire and Motion is how you get things done
in life. You have to move forward a little bit, every day.
It doesn&#8217;t matter if your code is lame and buggy and nobody
wants it. If you are moving forward, writing code and fixing
bugs constantly, time is on your side. Watch out when your
competition fires at you. Do they just want to force you to
keep busy reacting to their volleys, so you can&#8217;t move&nbsp;forward?</p>
