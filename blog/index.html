<p>Even though I&#8217;ve listed only a few books on the topic, last
year I read a lot about current technology and how it may
affect our society in the future. Ethics, machines that
&#8220;think,&#8221; and our inability to comprehend complexity around us
were the themes of the year, prompted by my <a href="/blog/what-is-fair-what-is-right.html">short post about
fairness</a> in late 2016.
Here are some of the books you should consider putting on your
reading list.

<p>As I was reflecting on the past year, the phrase &#8220;delicate
balance&#8221; was the only thing that came to mind. There is one
point at which opposing forces form a balance between work and
family time, between pushing yourself to the limit and taking
a break, and between being online and offline. There isn&#8217;t one
correct ratio&#8212;it depends on the individual and the
environment. I found mine in 2017.

         <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>My work matters,&#8221; you think to yourself. In a small studio,
shop, or a startup, everything you do is significant. You can
see your contributions pushing the business forward every day.
You feel good about&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re 1 of 3 people in a company, you&#8217;re almost a
superhero. If you&#8217;re 1 of 30, you might still feel you&#8217;re
contributing. But if you&#8217;re 1 of 3000, can you recognize your
impact on the whole business every day? If you leave for three
months, you&#8217;ll find the company somehow survived without you.
Shocking, right?

         <p>To be more specific, write down everything <strong>important</strong>.
Early in my corporate career, I asked an experienced designer
what had helped him make the transition from a small agency to
a big company. He suggested that I should keep a permanent
track of what&#8217;s happening for myself. Projects change and
people come and go so it&#8217;s hard to keep everything in memory.
