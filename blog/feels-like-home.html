<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>My childhood home was a horror movie set. A crumbling facade
failed to hide a century old building, and a leaky roof failed
to protect it from rain. The smell of wet walls invaded from
all sides. The entrance door squeaked, as expected. The
hallway lights never worked, and boards nailed over broken
windows blocked any street light. I was terrified getting to
our&nbsp;apartment.</p>
<p>After living there for more than twenty years, I stopped
seeing it as an old and scary building. Instead, it became my
home. My family was there, and my friends visited every week.
I had grown from a baby to a man and experienced everything
from joy to sorrow in that small apartment. Experiences and
memories transformed my&nbsp;perception.</p>
<p>I live far away today. When I visit, I enter the building and
images of old walls and wavy ceiling hit my retinas. My brain
doesn&#8217;t register them. My brain brings up childhood&nbsp;memories.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in an old building. I&#8217;m at&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>It took me thirty years to become aware of this illusion. And
mind you, I cherish it. However, it got me thinking about
work. Can the same thing happen with something we&#8217;re working
on at the moment? Can we become so familiar and comfortable
that we&#8217;re unable to see our work objectively anymore? How can
we redesign a software product, further medical research, or
improve customer service in that&nbsp;case?</p>
<p>Recovering from a self-imposed illusion is hard. I&#8217;m even
suspecting that it might be impossible if left for too long,
the same way I can&#8217;t perceive the old building&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>Two options come to&nbsp;mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bring in someone new<br />
   My wife told me recently that she was scared when she first
   visited my home. I can imagine why even though I
   experienced it differently. Having someone come in from
   outside and give honest feedback is a great way to break an&nbsp;illusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk away<br />
   Sometimes it&#8217;s too hard to detach or hear the truth. If
   you&#8217;re not providing value, the best course of action might
   be to walk away. Take on a different effort where you&#8217;ll be
   that new person with a fresh&nbsp;perspective.</p>
