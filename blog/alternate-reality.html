<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not implying any conspiracy theories or ill-doing
here. I was just intrigued by the parallels between recent
events in the real world and a fictional plot. Many big tech
companies and startups work in <span class="caps">VR</span> today. Consider this a fun
musing&nbsp;:)</em></p>
<p>I started to read <a href="http://readyplayerone.com/">Ready Player One</a>, a science fiction and
dystopian novel by Ernest Cline. It&#8217;s about a teenager being
pulled into an adventure in a digital world accessed through
<span class="caps">VR</span> goggles and haptic feedback&nbsp;gloves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the
videogame designer responsible for creating the <span class="caps">OASIS</span>, a
massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved
into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity
now used on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">OASIS</span> would ultimately change the way people around the
world lived, worked, and communicated. It would transform
entertainment, social networking, and even global politics.
Even though it was initially marketed as a new kind of
massively multiplayer online game, the <span class="caps">OASIS</span> quickly evolved
into a new way of&nbsp;life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the most interesting thing happens outside of the book, in
our own real&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>The book was published in 2011. Then, in 2012, <a href="https://www.oculus.com/">Oculus</a>
launches a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game">successful Kickstarter campaign</a> for their
virtual reality goggles Oculus Rift. They were the first one
to tackle <span class="caps">VR</span> by far, but they made a splash and popularized
the field once again. Their mission is to <em>&#8220;make it possible
to experience anything, anywhere, through the power of virtual&nbsp;reality.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971">Facebook announced</a> that they acquired Oculus
Rift for $2B. At F8 this year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouE6qyTc-l0&amp;t=8m">Facebook also stated their
mission</a>: <em>&#8220;Give everyone the power to share anything with&nbsp;anyone.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2016-04-20_f8.jpg" alt="Mark Zuckerberg giving his F8 keynote." /></p>
<p>Here are further descriptions of the virtual world from the&nbsp;book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">OASIS</span> quickly became the single most popular use for the
Internet, so much so that the terms &#8220;<span class="caps">OASIS</span>&#8221; and &#8220;Internet&#8221;
gradually became synonymous. And the incredibly easy-to-use
three-dimensional <span class="caps">OASIS</span> <span class="caps">OS</span>, which <span class="caps">GSS</span> gave away for free,
became the single most popular computer operating system in
the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Before long, billions of people around the world were
working and playing in the <span class="caps">OASIS</span> every day. Some of them
met, fell in love, and got married without ever setting foot
on the same continent. The lines of distinction between a
person&#8217;s real identity and that of their avatar began to&nbsp;blur.</p>
<p>It was the dawn of new era, one where most of the human race
now spent all of their free time inside a&nbsp;videogame.</p>
