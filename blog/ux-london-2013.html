<p>From 10th to 12th of April, London became the <span class="caps">UX</span> capital of
the world. The best people in the field gathered around for
inspiring talks and intensive workshops. Covering all the
talks during the three days of
<a href="http://2013.uxlondon.com"><span class="caps">UX</span> London</a> conference would fill a
small book, but luckily they were all centered around a few
themes and some surprising discoveries. Mind you, these are
all my personal impressions, so someone else might have
different&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We don’t know what will&nbsp;work&#8221;</h2>
<p>Designing something top down (<span class="caps">CEO</span> -&gt; designer -&gt; customer) in
one go and expecting it to solve all problems and make money
is a dream people who want safe and guaranteed results have.
It rarely works and some of the spectacular fails we’ve heard
at the conference just drive home the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>What designers should do instead is observe people, find
problems and pain points, design solutions and test them as
quickly as possible. It won’t be perfect from the first try
and that’s why they have to iterate quickly and often.
Working closely with a user or a customer is the key. This is
not new and some people were always aware of it, but I feel
it’s finally becoming mainstream. Very slowly, but&nbsp;certainly.</p>
<p>Most successful case studies presented at the conference were
done in that way. Methodologies like Lean <span class="caps">UX</span>, task modeling
and participatory design emerge from a need of a structured
and defined workflow. I’m very happy they were covered in
workshops by experienced&nbsp;practitioners.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2013-04-19_uxlondon2.jpg" alt="Post-it notes from a workshop." /></p>
<h2>The advance of technology is way faster than we&nbsp;think</h2>
<p>Computer power that doubles every 18 months, embedded devices
with more power than personal computers two decades ago,
robots that replace human labor and personalized genomics are
game changers most people are not aware of. They are not in
daily news or marketed to us as such, but they are omnipresent
through other products and services, and deeply affect social
and cultural changes for the last ten or fifteen&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>They are happening exponentially so it’s very hard to predict
what will happen. A few of the talks touched on similar
historical events and how people tried to fight “the new
order”. They failed. If it improves life conditions of the
majority, the technology will prevail. Always did and always&nbsp;will.</p>
<p>Due to fast changes, designers will find themselves without a
stable technology skill set and safe guidelines. The risk and
uncertainties will be heightened. The only thing that will
change very slowly is human nature. Embrace those as facts and
work with them, not against them. Be proactive, learn
aggressively and open your mind to new experiences to stay
ahead of the&nbsp;curve.</p>

<h2>There are no <span class="caps">UX</span>&nbsp;gods</h2>
<p>Most speakers at the conference were well known and respected.
They hold high positions in their organizations and many think
of them very highly, sometimes attributing them with divine
aura or&nbsp;insight.</p>
<p>And then you go outside waiting for your lunch and see they
are getting wet in the rain, too. Some can’t function without
a coffee in the morning. Some have trembling fingers and
voices when walking on a stage. When asked about a problem you
have, they don’t have a sure-fire solution. And that’s a very
good thing for two&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When you see someone is not perfect, he or she appears more
   accessible. Everyone at the conference was extra friendly
   and receptive to all questions and comments, between talks
   or during workshops. To learn, grow and create is only
   possible in that kind of&nbsp;environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also means they have similar problems and hurdles along
   the way as much as you do. But they worked and learned a
   lot, and created something notable. If it was possible for
   them, normal people, then we should be able to do it too.
   And I believe that’s something every speaker tried to
   convey – &#8220;You can do it also. Now go and do&nbsp;it.&#8221;</p>
