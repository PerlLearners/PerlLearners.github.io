<p>The amount of time a person has in a day is finite. Although
such an obvious statement is seldom worth repeating, it became
my daily reminder since my son&#8217;s birth a couple of months&nbsp;ago. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived through time-constrained situations before, but
they were never so clear-cut as the current one. For example,
if I had 20 things I wanted to do in a month&#8212;like exercising,
reading, going out, or watching movies&#8212;and enough time to do
only half of them, I was still able to do a lot. That created
an impression that I was on top of things. I could shuffle
various activities around and always remove one to make more
time for another. I embraced the flexibility and in turn
sacrificed some&nbsp;focus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s different now. Let&#8217;s say I still have 20 things I would
like to do plus one extra&#8212;family. I dedicate most of my time
to my son and my wife because it&#8217;s the most enjoyable and the
most significant activity, but that leaves me with only two
other free slots to fill in. And here lies the problem: If I
try to go through all the things I would like to do by
constantly changing them in the time I have left, it is going
to be neither productive nor&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>I tried to cheat recently, and I squeezed in one more activity
pretending I have three slots. &#8220;I&#8217;ll manage somehow,&#8221; I said
to myself. Guess who didn&#8217;t write for a month. The &#8220;finite
time&#8221; maxim proved right&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The time constraint made me think deeply about my priorities,
and I realized I was conducting a brutal prioritization
process. Is this something I love and can&#8217;t leave on the side?
If I skip it, will my family be worse off? If the answer is
&#8220;no&#8221;, it won&#8217;t happen. There were many noes, much more than I
would have&nbsp;preferred.</p>
<p>At the same time, the prioritization distilled what is truly
important to me. Even though I have less free time now, I am
more focused on activities that improve my life and&nbsp;happiness.</p></div>
