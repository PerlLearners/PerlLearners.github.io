<p>Some of the best books I&#8217;ve read in my life were those I read
in 2016. Here are my top picks from the past&nbsp;year.</p>
<h2>Flow</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I waited so long to read this classic from
Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. Maybe it was for the better because
my experience over the last two decades aligned with research
from the book: trying to improve whatever you do and immersing
yourself in body, mind, or social activities will lead to the
flow state (being in the zone). That, ultimately, results in&nbsp;happiness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow">Goodreads</a></p>
<h2>The Beginning of&nbsp;Infinity</h2>
<p>This one is hard to summarize. The central theme is
explanations and how they hold power to change and influence,
ultimately opening the door to infinite progress. David
Deutsch does an excellent job of tying physics, math, culture,
creativity, and philosophy under the same umbrella. The book
is dense; you&#8217;ll have to stop and ponder many times while
reading it. However, if you love science, this will be one of
the best books you will&nbsp;read.</p>

<h2>Steal Like an Artist / Share Your&nbsp;Work</h2>
<p>These two short books pack practical advice and simple steps
for pursuing your artistic side. I was delighted by how
concise and honest they are. I have nothing else to add.
Just read&nbsp;them.</p>

<h2>#askGaryVee</h2>

<p>Gary Vaynerchuk is a known figure among digital marketers and
many tech workers. His #askGaryVee book is a compilation of
questions he was asked over the years. Although I don&#8217;t agree
with all his answers, the majority of them are illuminating,
helpful, and sometimes even merciless in getting to the core
of the problem. I would certainly recommend an audiobook
version because Gary narrates the book himself. His energy and
passion will pour out of your&nbsp;headphones.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;Information</h2>
<p>James Gleick masterfully writes about the history of
information: from oral communication and African drums to
encoding of information and the birth of computing. I enjoyed
The Information as much as a good thriller. The book is
accessible to everyone, but geeks will get a kick out of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><a href="https://around.com/the-information/">https://around.com/the-information/</a>  </p>
<h2>The best interface is no&nbsp;interface</h2>
<p>Golden Krishna&#8217;s well-written rant should be renamed to &#8220;If
you&#8217;re thinking about creating a new screen-based interface,
think again.&#8221; I believe that it&#8217;s impossible to have no
interface. The simplest way we communicate&#8212;speaking and
hearing&#8212;is an interface consisting of air pressure and
information encoding. That said, Golden has a point: creating
a new screen-based interface for every new feature we think of
is not solving a problem, it&#8217;s being lazy. Understanding
person&#8217;s needs and addressing a problem in a way that will not
add friction is hard work, but it is the ideal we should
strive for every&nbsp;time.</p>

<h2>Alone&nbsp;together</h2>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s about how social networks, smartphones, and
robots affect our emotional lives. From the author&#8217;s&nbsp;website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The book] is the result of <span class="caps">MIT</span> technology and society
specialist Sherry Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration
of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews
with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new,
unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents,
and children, and new instabilities in how we understand
privacy and community, intimacy and solitude. [&#8230;]
Technology promises to let us do anything from anywhere with
anyone. But it also drains us as we try to do everything
everywhere. In a surprising twist, relentless connection
leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill
the void, but as technology ramps up, our emotional lives
ramp&nbsp;down.</p>

<h2>Peak: Secrets from the New Science of&nbsp;Expertise</h2>
<p>Anders Ericsson is a researcher of expert performance and Peak
is his popular science book that summarizes decades of his
work. Malcolm Gladwell used some of that research for his
bestseller Outliers and propagated the idea of &#8220;10,000 hours
to mastery&#8221; (which is not really true). If you&#8217;re into
learning and self-improvement, you&#8217;ll love this&nbsp;book.</p>
<p><a href="http://peakthebook.com/">http://peakthebook.com/</a></p>
<h2>Sapiens: A Brief History of&nbsp;Humankind</h2>
<p>Describing the history of humankind in 400 pages is a daunting
task, but Yuval Noah Harari takes it head on. He starts with
the idea that &#8220;Homo sapiens rules the world because it is the
only animal that can believe in things that exist purely in
its own imagination, such as gods, states, money and human
rights,&#8221; and then dives deep into transformative events and
discoveries in our history. Part enlightening, part
disturbing, I assure you this book will change how you see our
existence in this&nbsp;world.</p>

<h2>Disrupted</h2>
<p>From <a href="http://www.realdanlyons.com/">http://www.realdanlyons.com/</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For twenty-five years Dan Lyons was a magazine writer at the
top of his profession – until one Friday morning when his
editor at Newsweek told him that his job as technology
editor no longer existed. HubSpot, a Boston tech startup
with a kooky culture, offered Dan a pile of stock options
and gave him the vague title of &#8220;marketing fellow.&#8221; What
could possibly go wrong? In a word,&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>Mixed in with Dan&#8217;s uproarious tale of a job from hell is a
trenchant analysis of startup culture and a poignant,
painfully honest account of being middle-aged and struggling
to pursue personal reinvention. Disrupted has been hailed by
critics as a book that will make you laugh, but also will
make you&nbsp;think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Total&nbsp;recall</h2>
<p>The autobiography of Arnold Schwarzenegger surprised me.
Whatever you may think of him as a person, his successes are
noteworthy. He was the undisputed bodybuilding champion. He
became a successful real estate businessman. He started an
acting career without any qualifications and then raised to
the top where he managed to gross $20-30 million per movie. He
transitioned to politics where he ended up as a governor of
California. Today he wins the Internet through social media
and drives a <span class="caps">WW2</span> tank for charity. Any of these
accomplishments would be enough to call someone successful,
but achieving all of them is astounding. The book is about his
journey, but most of all, about cultivating a growth&nbsp;mindset.</p>

<h2>Living with a <span class="caps">SEAL</span></h2>
<p>People who feel they are stuck in a rut talk to a friend or
try a different hobby. Not Jesse Itzler. Jesse decided to hire
an ex-<span class="caps">SEAL</span> to bring some novelty into his life. The deal goes
like this: &#8220;come live with my family and me for a month, and I
have to do whatever and whenever you tell me to do.&#8221; The
month-long diary is both hilarious and inspiring, and
hopefully will motivate you to step out of your comfort&nbsp;zone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25066990-living-with-a-seal">Goodreads</a></p>
<h2>Algorithms to live&nbsp;by</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how many people you should interview
before hiring, or how many apartments to explore before
renting? How about the best way to sort books and socks? Or is
choosing between your favorite meal and trying something new
your daily struggle? These look like uniquely human problems,
but they all have analogies in the world of computers.
Thankfully, computer scientists have been solving them for
decades, and Brian and Tom wrote a delightful and approachable
book where they share those ideas and&nbsp;solutions.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;Martian</h2>
<p>The science fiction story of Mark Watney getting stranded on
Mars after a freak space accident is known worldwide. &#8220;The
Martian&#8221; movie had 7 Academy Awards nominations, but it
doesn&#8217;t come close to the novel when it comes to suspense,
science details, and Mark&#8217;s witty jokes. If you didn&#8217;t watch
the movie, please pick up the book; you won&#8217;t regret it. I
read it in one&nbsp;day.</p>

<h2>Ready Player&nbsp;One</h2>
<p>Life is harsh and the world is an ugly place in 2044. The only
safe space is a virtual world named <span class="caps">OASIS</span> where the majority
of people spend their time. Teenager Wade is always plugged
in, and he is trying to solve puzzles left by the creator of
<span class="caps">OASIS</span> that would lead Wade to immense power and wealth. The
puzzles are full of references to 80s pop culture, so even
though the book is for everyone, those 30 and older will feel
at&nbsp;home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ernestcline.com/books/rpo/">http://www.ernestcline.com/books/rpo/</a></p>
<p>After reading the book, I wrote <a href="/blog/alternate-reality.html">a short piece</a> comparing the world from the
book and our current tech progression and trajectory. It turns
out the book is not so sci-fi after&nbsp;all.</p>
<h2>The Power of the&nbsp;Dog</h2>
<p>The story follows <span class="caps">DEA</span> agent Art Keller in his fight against
Mexican cartels from the mid-70s to late 90s. The thriller is
hard to put down, but even better than the author&#8217;s masterful
writing is how he follows and explains real world events in
the drug trade across Americas. The best history and geography
lesson on the topic I ever&nbsp;had.</p>
