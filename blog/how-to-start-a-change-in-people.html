<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>By doing it yourself in the first place.&#8221; The answer is
deceivingly simple, but it works. People love consistency and
actions that match words. In those situations they feel safe,
can develop rapport and trust, which is usually followed by
accepting ideas and habits over a longer&nbsp;period.</p>
<p>Human communication had begun long before spoken or written
word came into existence. That means we had to master reading
body language to be able to convey and receive a lot of
information. Even after we got hold of the full communication
repertoire, the body language is still dominant channel which
we use to get around 70-80% of information when&nbsp;communicating.</p>
<p>When spoken words and body signals are out of sync, our brains
fire a lot of warnings, even if we&#8217;re not consciously aware of
it. This usually results in distrust, doubt, and similar
negative emotions. If it happens regularly, we&#8217;ll mark the
offenders as not likable or with a hidden agenda, and we&#8217;ll
usually try to distance ourselves from&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Body language is short-term and immediate, but the same
principles apply for a broad range of complex human behavior,
habits and&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<h2>It starts when we&#8217;re&nbsp;born</h2>
<p>Most of the things we learn come from observation and mimicry.
Our parents serve as the first role models and our peers take
over later in school. As the time passes, more factual things
are learned orally or by reading, but the majority of things
that affect our behavior are still learned by&nbsp;observing.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that nothing changes when we grow up.
By that time we have more experience and can catch more subtle
signals, which means other people&#8217;s actions only affect us&nbsp;more.</p>
<h2>A scientific&nbsp;theory</h2>
<p>There is a relatively new theory of <em>mirror neurons</em> that
could explain why learning by observation happens. An
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/vs_ramachandran_the_neurons_that_shaped_civilization.html">interesting talk on <span class="caps">TED</span></a> by V. Ramachandran, one of the
researchers in the field, explains a theory in eight minutes.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">Wikipedia article</a> on the topics&nbsp;says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal
acts and when the animal observes the same action performed
by another. Thus, the neuron &#8220;mirrors&#8221; the behavior of the
other, as though the observer were itself acting. &#8230;
Researchers argue that mirror neurons may be important for
understanding the actions of other people, and for learning
new skills by&nbsp;imitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you&#8217;re watching a person performing an action, it&#8217;s
almost like you&#8217;re doing it&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<h2>Make the most of&nbsp;it</h2>
<p>Science will eventually show us <em>why</em> this phenomenon happens,
but the fact that it&#8217;s happening since time immemorial is
undisputed. There are a few ways you can use it to benefit
yourself or&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>If you want to start a positive change in yourself, surround
yourself with people who exhibit such behavior. It&#8217;s sometimes
hard to find motivation and energy to follow through hard
decisions and to make it a habit, but if people around you are
doing it every day, your chances are much, much higher. The
common saying that a person is mostly influenced by the five
closest people is&nbsp;true.</p>
<p>To influence someone else you have to be a part of the closest
circle of peers or a perceived&nbsp;authority.</p>
<p><strong>Peers</strong>. One example is getting an addition to your
development team. What you and your teammates would like is
that this new person adopts team&#8217;s best practices in coding
standards. One effective way is to talk to your team
beforehand and ask them to be careful and aware of the things
they do because the new teammate will look at their work and
try to, with some instruction and mentoring, copy the existing
workflow. The first time someone makes a shortcut or a sloppy
piece of work in code, documentation or commit messages during
the &#8220;learning&#8221; phase, your credibility is significantly
undermined. What you have just demonstrated is that it&#8217;s
sometimes <span class="caps">OK</span> to deliver suboptimal work due to time
constraints or negligence, even if it backfires in the long
run. That&#8217;s probably not what you intended, but the message is
transferred nevertheless. I mentioned at the start of this
article that people love consistency, and it&#8217;s crucial in
cases like&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Authority</strong>. Teachers, bosses, religious leaders, experts in
a domain have a particular authority, and if you&#8217;re one of
them, it&#8217;s much easier to start a positive change. You don&#8217;t
need a circle of people (although it&#8217;s much easier and
effective that way) and you can influence a lot of people at
the same time.  The downside is that all eyes are pointing to
you and watching all the time. Consciously or not, every step
is analyzed and dissected. Many people in that position make a
mistake of thinking that <em>only what they say</em> counts and that
couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth. Watchers are connecting
every word you say with your actions, and if they misalign,
trust evaporates like dew in a&nbsp;dessert.</p>
<p>A teacher who scolds children for being late on class but
regularly fails to make it on time on the first morning class
is not a great role model. If they ask the teacher why there
are double standards and the only answer is &#8220;because I&#8217;m a
teacher&#8221;, guess who won&#8217;t be invited to a reunion or mentioned
as a childhood&nbsp;inspiration.</p>
<p>A manager who preaches open and healthy communication, but
often withholds information, talks about people behind their
backs and never in their face or criticizes them publicly will
find no one supporting his initiatives or even worse, find his
subordinates mirroring his behavior and driving the company
culture to the&nbsp;ground.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an owner of a small business hit by a bad cash flow
period and need to make some cuts, the best way would be to
communicate the problem openly to your employees. After the
measures have been set and put into motion, be very conscious
of your actions. Do you need a new computer you&#8217;re using for
email and documents only or maybe one of your designers can
make a better use for it? Switch to a smaller car, take the
biggest pay cut and avoid expensive business dinners. When
people see you live by your words every day, they will soon
follow. Some of them will willingly leave a course to save
money; others will try harder to get a discount from a
supplier. Not getting a bonus will hurt less if you give up
yours. With a clear goal and people supporting you, it&#8217;s very
likely you&#8217;ll soon&nbsp;recover.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>People are very complex beings. Starting a change in others is
not a trivial thing. A person needs to be motivated to do it,
but that can often be accomplished with open communication and
a clear goal. The second ingredient is what this article is
all about - serving as a role model. That&#8217;s the harder part.
&#8220;1% inspiration and 99% perspiration&#8221; comes immediately to&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>Before you start telling others what to do, look at yourself
first. If you&#8217;re keen on inspiring your friends, cultivating a
company culture or building rapport, always lead with an
example. And do it&nbsp;consistently.</p></div>
