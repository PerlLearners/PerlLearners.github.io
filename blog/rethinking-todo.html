<p>Buy groceries, reply to emails, pick up the package from the
post office, organize the weekend trip, revise the insurance
premium. The list is like a hydra: I cross off one and two
more appear. It is, of course, my personal &#8220;to do&#8221; list. No
work, no side projects, just stuff that needs to be done for
life to proceed in a regular&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>I winced every time I glanced at the list. If I finished the
first couple of tasks&#8212;and this is usually all I could do in
one day&#8212;I would get no sense of accomplishment because dozens
of uncompleted tasks would stare back at me and remind me I
will never attain the peace of&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>Why was just looking at the unfinished list bothering me? I
couldn&#8217;t pinpoint the problem until I heard about the
Zeigarnik effect. Named after the psychologist who first
studied it, the Zeigarnik effect shows that people will think
more about uncompleted or interrupted tasks than completed&nbsp;ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A study done by Greist-Bousquet and Schiffman (1992)
provided evidence for the Zeigarnik Effect. In this paper,
the authors stated that there is a tendency or &#8220;need&#8221; to
complete a task once it has been initiated and the lack of
closure that stems from an unfinished task promotes some
continued task-related cognitive effort. The cognitive
effort that comes with these intrusive thoughts of the
unfinished task is terminated only once the person returns
to complete the&nbsp;task.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect">Quote source</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03330382">research&nbsp;paper</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people have criticized the effect. It turns out that it
is not as strong, and sometimes even negligible if people are
not motivated enough to finish a task. Since my list was what
I wanted or needed to do, the effect on me was strong and was
wearing me&nbsp;down.</p>
<h2>Addressing the&nbsp;problem</h2>
<p>If I avoided the list for a while, I eventually forgot my
ongoing obligations. I didn&#8217;t have anything on my mind, and
that resulted in serenity. However, every time I looked at the
list, it reminded me of all the things I needed to do, and I
started to&nbsp;worry.</p>
<p>I decided the problem needs to be solved. It was taking too
big of a toll every day to let it run&nbsp;loose.</p>
<p>So, what was the cause of the problem? Too many items in a
list that I would never do in one day. I was thinking about
separating the list by size and priority into smaller buckets,
but I would still have to reference the buckets frequently and
spend extra time on managing items between them. It seemed
like that wouldn&#8217;t work for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>When I scanned the list again, one thing became apparent: only
a tiny fraction of items had to be done that day, while a
significant chunk couldn&#8217;t be done soon at all. The items I
couldn&#8217;t do were dependent on future events, bigger blocks of
free time, or actions of other people. For example, I couldn&#8217;t
revise my insurance premium until I received additional
information from someone, or I couldn&#8217;t research something
until the weekend when I would have more free&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The realization that most items are time bound shifted my
thinking from &#8220;buckets&#8221; to &#8220;a timeline.&#8221; What if I could hide
items on the list and they show up only when I could do
something about&nbsp;them?</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2016-11-03_buckets_and_timeline.svg" alt="A comparison between todo entries in buckets and on a
timeline." /></p>
<p>I started to shop for a tool that would allow me the workflow
I had envisioned. At the same time, I wanted to keep it as
simple as possible and not introduce too many new products or&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>The only digital destination I visited every day was my
private email inbox. I was receiving a small enough number of
emails per day that it was manageable, but I had no idea how
to add new items (except emailing myself which I don&#8217;t like to
do) or temporarily hide existing&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p>One of the potential tools was Inbox by Gmail. I had tried it
once before, but we hadn&#8217;t clicked together. I remembered it
had the option to add reminders as standalone entries or to
existing emails, and it was possible to snooze any item in the
inbox. Snoozing is especially interesting because it would
address my timeline problem. I decided to try it again with a
different&nbsp;mindset.</p>
<p><img src="/media/external/2016-11-03_inbox_screenshot.jpg" alt="Image description." /></p>
<p>I won&#8217;t dwell on Inbox or its features here because I&#8217;m more
interested in the process. You can check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCo3zZ0P4vU">this nifty
introduction video</a> for Inbox to see how reminders and
snoozing work. The important thing is that it finally allowed
me to handle my <span class="caps">TODO</span> entries as I&nbsp;wanted.</p>
<h2>My ideal&nbsp;workflow</h2>
<p>My workflow now looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything that&#8217;s on my list has to be done in the next
  couple of&nbsp;hours.</li>
<li>If I can&#8217;t do it in that time or if I receive something that
  I can&#8217;t address immediately, I snooze it for when I can.
  Usual snooze times, for which there are helpful shortcuts,
  are tonight, tomorrow, this weekend, and next&nbsp;week.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is lightweight and fast. The result is that things
pop up only when I can do something about them and that most
of the time my list is empty. This emptiness, the lack of an
endless and ever-present <span class="caps">TODO</span> list, finally released me from
the Zeigarnik effect. I often open the app only to find
nothing in it, and that makes me relax a bit. I don&#8217;t have
anything urgent to do, and I can turn to more important things
in&nbsp;life.</p></div>
