<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>If you looked at online portfolios or &#8220;inspirational&#8221; websites
lately, you have probably noticed isometric or skewed
mock-ups. It seems they&#8217;re the hottest thing at the&nbsp;moment.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/media/external/2016-08-17_isometric_mockups.jpg" />
<figcaption class="figure-caption">I didn&#8217;t want to put anyone on the spot, so I created a demo
from screenshots of my website. The mock-ups or screenshots
are usually skewed and then tiled next to each other.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have been interviewing job candidates in the last year, and
observed isometric mock-ups slowly creep into design
portfolios. After giving it enough thought, I can think of
only one benefit for presenting your work this way and many&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say candidates comes to the interview and decide to do
the right thing: instead of showing only screens or images
they had designed, they tell a story of their process and
impact. If they want to give more context around the product
they worked on, and decide to show how people use it in real
life or compare it to something else, then using isometric
screens is perfectly&nbsp;fine.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/media/external/2016-08-17_isometric_book.jpg" />
<figcaption class="figure-caption">An image for marketing purposes needs to evoke a feeling or
compare ideas. This image might show how an app can replace a
whole reference book so you don&#8217;t have to carry it around.
Using an isometric screen here is justified because analyzing
the quality of work is not the goal.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="/media/external/2016-08-17_isometric_table.jpg" />
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Building a photo story may require showing how a software
product operates in real life. For example, remote
collaboration, warehouse management, in-store payments,
and similar use-cases.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, showing mock-ups in context is usually not the
use-case I encounter; the tiled cards type dominates. It&#8217;s
hard, and often impossible, to follow the intended flow when
designers arrange cards in this way. I usually get the feel of
the style, but can&#8217;t see any details. Typography, readability,
and text clarity get lost through scaling down and skewing
original images. Projecting it on a wall or a <span class="caps">TV</span> display
decreases the image quality even&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Using the isometric mock-ups approach exclusively tells me
that at least one of the following statements is true about
the&nbsp;candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>They didn&#8217;t think about their audience&#8217;s point of view and
  the absence of context required to understand what&#8217;s on the
  screens (lack of&nbsp;empathy)</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t know how to tell a story (lack of&nbsp;skill)</li>
<li>They quickly follow trends (lack of judgment and&nbsp;experience)</li>
<li>They want to cover up things they didn&#8217;t do well (dubious&nbsp;character) </li>
</ul>
<p>I imagine this is the last thing interview candidates or
designers publishing their portfolios want other people to
take&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>Please refrain from using isometric mockups for displaying
your work. There are a couple of good uses for them, but they
shouldn&#8217;t be your main presentation style. I made a similar
mistake when I was starting out. I was inexperienced, and I
thought it looked cool and trendy. Don&#8217;t be me, be&nbsp;better.</p></div>
