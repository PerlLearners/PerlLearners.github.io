<p>One senior developer friend asked me to recommend him
three books about user experience design. After I had sent him
an email with the list and some helpful tips, it seemed
reasonable to share it with everyone. Here are the top
three books, in no particular order, from my reading&nbsp;list.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470084111.html">About Face 3 - The Essentials of Interaction Design</a><br />
It&#8217;s long, but very easy to read. The book starts with
describing user mental models, user goals and the whole design
process. It finishes with specific examples and patterns you
can use in your daily&nbsp;workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">Don’t Make Me Think - A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</a><br />
A world famous classic. It&#8217;s very short, but packs a lot of
usability tips and it&#8217;s tailored for beginners. The problem
domain is Web, but can be easily applied to other&nbsp;environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/the-design-of-everyday-things.html">The Design of Everyday Things</a><br />
Also a classic, from the 80s. It describes design in general
from a very high level, showing examples of good and bad
(often industrial) design to drive the point home. It&#8217;s
excellent to put you in the &#8220;design good things&#8221; mindset.
There is also a <a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/design-of-everyday-things-revised.html">new revised edition</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All three are on the <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/24/usability-and-interface-design-books/">Smashing Magazine list</a> of
&#8220;Usability and Interface Design Books&#8221;. Two other books I can
recommend from there are <a href="http://designinginterfaces.com/">Designing Interfaces</a>
(collection of design patterns, very good as a reference) and
<a href="http://www.id-book.com/">Interaction Design</a> (similar to About Face 3, but more
in depth and academical; recommended for serious&nbsp;practitioners).</p>
<p>One area that has been a gold mine for my work is cognitive
psychology. It&#8217;s <em>&#8220;the study of mental processes such as
attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving,
and thinking&#8221;</em>. I think every designer should study it because
it&#8217;s a window into human behavior. One of the best books in
the field I&#8217;ve read until now is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">Thinking, Fast and
Slow</a> by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman. It won&#8217;t
teach you how to pick the best colors, but will show you how
people decide, why they like not losing more than winning
something of equal value, why people jump to conclusions as
shortcuts and what mistakes they make along the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>The whole list is subjective and based on books I&#8217;ve read. If
you have some other recommendations worth reading that are not
mentioned here, please <a href="https://twitter.com/merlinrebrovic">let me know on Twitter</a>.</p></div>
