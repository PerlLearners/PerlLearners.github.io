<p>I became a parent last month and the way I use technology has
changed in a way I didn&#8217;t expect. I do way more things with
one hand than before. A newborn baby requires a lot of
attention and there are always some chores to do. For the most
part, I didn&#8217;t use a tablet at all, mostly my phone. I use
swiping instead of typing with two hands (thumbs); that&#8217;s how
I wrote this post. I read and try to tap on things while on
the move, so there is a lot of shaking and imprecision. I
often lay down my phone and read from a distance because I
need space and both hands to do&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>You can probably assume I&#8217;m writing this because the text is
too small and the user interface doesn&#8217;t scale well with
increasing its default size. There are also a lot of misplaced
taps and sometimes it&#8217;s hard to undo a slip I make. Some
actions like zoom-in/out are almost impossible to do with one
hand, but they shouldn&#8217;t be. And don&#8217;t get me started on
oversized&nbsp;phones.</p>
<p>The described behavior might as well come from a person with a
disability or an impairment. That&#8217;s why accessibility is
important, not only for people with medical problems, but also
for those who find themselves in new and diverse situations
where they can&#8217;t use technology in an optimal&nbsp;way.</p></div>
