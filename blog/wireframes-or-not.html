<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I found it interesting that there were a few presentations at
<span class="caps">UX</span> London with what seemed as conflicting views of how a <span class="caps">UX</span>
workflow should unfold. <a href="https://twitter.com/jboogie">Jeff Gothelf</a>
was in favor of testing assumptions with his Lean <span class="caps">UX</span> approach
as soon as possible. He mentioned a case where they used
wireframes and <span class="caps">PDF</span> prototypes to check if an idea and a
potential solution made sense before writing one line of code.
On the other hand, <a href="https://twitter.com/benterrett">Ben Terrett</a>
from fascinating gov.uk team says they sketch a bit and then
jump directly to coding in the&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>My mind immediately started to evaluate which one was better.
It seems this is a normal human behaviour when presented with
two options. It took me a few days before my mind settled on
another one - they both work, but under different
circumstances. Let me explain that a&nbsp;bit.</p>
<p>To build something a target audience would like and use, there
has to be a <em>shared understanding</em> between team members and
future customers. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s usually not the case.
The whole process, from defining goals, discovery, specs,
wireframes to final design and implementation, serves as a way
to coordinate everyone, get their visions aligned, test ideas
and then build it. I look at the whole process as a staircase,
each step bringing you closer to your goals. The steps are not
important; getting on the next floor&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Framed that way, it&#8217;s easy to find situations where it&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> to
skip a few steps. If goals are well defined and tested, a team
works together for a long time or there aren&#8217;t a lot of
stakeholders that need reporting or explaining, it&#8217;s very
likely there is a high level of <em>shared understanding</em>
already. If a designer and a developer know exactly what to
build and how it should look like, there are no good reasons
for a designer to spend time sketching wireframes he&#8217;ll use to
explain something everyone already&nbsp;knows.</p>
<p>Ideally, one would need only a few steps to reach a goal. But
as a project gets bigger, riskier or with more people
involved, don&#8217;t be afraid to add more steps. If you try to
jump over too many of them in the dark, you&#8217;ll&nbsp;slip.</p></div>
