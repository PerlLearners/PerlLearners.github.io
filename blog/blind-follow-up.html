<p>About two months ago I did a &#8220;<a href="/blog/blind-for-a-day.html">blind for a day</a>&#8221; experiment and
the feedback I got afterward was overwhelmingly positive. A
quick online search shows that I wasn&#8217;t the first person to do
it, which was expected, but it also points to the other side
of the experience&#8212;negative reactions to the experiment from
the visually impaired or reasons why sighted people should not
do it. It boils down to comments like&nbsp;this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really find these whatever for a day experiments really
patronizing and irritating. People tend to walk away with a
smug satisfaction that they know how it is to be blind/deaf/in
a chair, but they can take off the blindfold&nbsp;whenever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then bro&nbsp;fisting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, these blindfolds/glasses are only good for a short
time. They don&#8217;t let you experience visual impairment like
we all have different versions of. I can imagine that smug
look and it pisses me&nbsp;off!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoa!&nbsp;Really?</p>
<p>I can understand some people are frustrated by their current
condition and that some sighted experimenters behave like
they&#8217;ve accomplished world peace, but comments like these are
not helping anyone. Why not try with <em>&#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s more to it
than it seems. Would you like to learn about&nbsp;it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Luckily, there are positive stories where both sighted and
unsighted people work together to build empathy. For example,
there are &#8220;<a href="http://www.dialogue-in-the-dark.com/">Dialogue in the Dark</a>&#8221; exhibitions where&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; visitors are led by blind guides through a specially
constructed and completely darkened space. Conveying the
characteristics of a familiar environment such as a park, a
street or a bar, a daily routine turns into a new experience.
&#8230; Conducted by blind coaches and facilitators, participants
are guided through a set of experiential learning activities
and experience a reinforcement of their collaborative
mind-set and emotional&nbsp;intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second positive example I found was <a href="http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/01/a-vision-of-coding-without-opening-your-eyes.html?m=1">an article by a young
blind programmer</a>. To introduce his world to others, he
describes how he codes, what tools he uses, and what problems
he faces. There is even a recording of a screen reader going
through some source code; it&#8217;s utterly incomprehensible to
me, but fascinating how someone&#8217;s brain can pick that&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>To close with something inspiring, have a look at the first
reaction of a blind patient fitted with bionic eyes.
Technology does wonders when used in a right way. And who
knows, in a couple of decades this article may be an
interesting historical record in a new world without&nbsp;blindness.</p>
