<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I am always asking people and scouring the Internet for good
book recommendations. Even though I exchange tips in person, I
rarely broadcast what is worthy of your time. Time to change&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The year 2015 was not as good as some others with regards to
drowning in good reads, but there were some golden nuggets I
would like to&nbsp;share. </p>
<h2>Man&#8217;s search for&nbsp;meaning</h2>
<p>Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl lost his family and survived Nazi
imprisonment. His experience and those of others who came to
him for treatment after the war led him to coin a theory
stating that our primary drive in life is the pursuit of what
we find meaningful. We often can&#8217;t avoid suffering, but we can
decide how to cope with it. In the end, our mindset is more
important than our&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>I used some of the quotes from the book in my post about
<a href="/blog/humor-and-meaningfulness.html">humor and meaningfulness</a>.</p>
<h2>Work&nbsp;rules!</h2>
<p>Laszlo Bock was leading Google&#8217;s People Ops for a decade
during company&#8217;s rapid growth. In his book he openly shares
successful techniques for hiring, motivating, and compensating
people, but also talks about lessons learned from failed
experiments. If you&#8217;re managing a team or running a company,
this is a book for&nbsp;you.</p>

<h2>Customs of the&nbsp;World</h2>
<p>This is a course by The Great Courses, but I consumed it as an
audiobook. Aside from being an interesting history lesson, the
course compares major cultures of the world against ten
dimensions: individualists versus collectivist, direct versus
indirect, punctuality versus relationships, and so on. I
currently work in a highly diverse environment, and the book
helped me understand why people from different cultures behave
in their ways and how to adapt to different communication&nbsp;styles.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s Complicated: the Social Lives of Networked&nbsp;Teens</h2>
<p>A Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Danah Boyd writes
about young people&#8217;s use of social media. She explores what
networks they use, how it affects their lives, and debunks
myths about teens being careless oversharers and social media&nbsp;addicts.</p>

<h2>Astronaut&#8217;s guide to life on&nbsp;Earth</h2>
<p>The final two books are unique because they explore peculiar
jobs. The first one is a memoir of the astronaut Colonel Chris
Hadfield. He explains his long journey from a young age to
working inside the International Space Station. Aside from
telling humorous and inspiring stories, he also tries to teach
us a valuable life lesson: prepare for the worst and think
through potential failures because this is the only way to
stay calm under immense&nbsp;stress.</p>

<h2>Junkyard&nbsp;Planet</h2>
<p>A vast majority of people don&#8217;t think about where all things
they throw away end up. But it has to go somewhere, and for an
industry mostly hidden from our view, it is a gold mine. Adam
Minter lead us through the <span class="caps">US</span> and Chinese recycling operations
which often are, although better than mining, not as &#8220;green&#8221;
as we think they are. This book is an&nbsp;eyeopener.</p>

<p>I hope you will this list helpful and put some of these books on your reading&nbsp;list.</p>
