<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>If you didn&#8217;t already notice, machines are deciding what news
we see, what &#8220;facts&#8221; we learn, and what music we listen to
next, but also who will be denied credit or who should be
detained based on a predicted risk of criminal activity (<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">and
they are doing it poorly</a>). As algorithms get more
sophisticated and data becomes more plentiful, machines will
do even more: deciding on medical procedures, educational
opportunities, and how our cars&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>In other words, machines will direct a substantial part of
your life. This presents a problem because you want the
decisions to be fair and right, but what does that mean? We
all think we know what is right, but it is only our opinion
and personal perspective. People are diverse. We live in
different cultural, religious, political, and economic
spheres, and those shape our worldviews, whether we are aware
of it or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Morality is constructed by humans. There is nothing in nature
that determines what is universally right or wrong; there is
no objective measure. Thousands of years of philosophy didn&#8217;t
bring us any closer to the unified truth, only to constant
conflict. However, with the rise of computing, we are forced
for the first time to extract the decision-making model from
our minds and put it somewhere else. We will have to quantify
philosophical musings and the way we do that will define our&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Two extremes define the range of possible&nbsp;outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>We agree on objective measures of human fairness and
   incorporate them in algorithms that will run our&nbsp;lives.</li>
<li>We do nothing and let machines pick up our biases in data
   they&nbsp;analyze.</li>
</ol>
<p>The extreme outcomes sound either improbable or undesirable.
Is there a middle ground that will push the humanity forward
and not leave anyone&nbsp;behind?</p></div>
