<p>I discovered this phrase years ago as one of Toyota Production
System&#8217;s core principles. Genchi genbutsu roughly translates
to &#8220;go and see for yourself&#8221;. It means you have to come to the
place where actual work is done and observe. This is the only
way to understand a problem and come up with a&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>The Japanese words sounds mysterious and wise, but there are
Western counterparts to this idea too. For example, serial
entrepreneur <a href="http://steveblank.com">Steve Blank</a> has been saying for a long time
that the key to startup success is &#8220;getting out of the
building&#8221;. Lean startup movement follows Steve&#8217;s Customer
development method. It revolves around the same idea of
validating assumptions early on. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_wandering_around">Management by wandering
around</a> is an even older method that produces equal&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>Designers and entrepreneurs assume a lot about the world and
people in it. The assumptions are often incorrect and lead to
failure. Although I have known this for a long time, its
importance has sunk in only recently. It was, of course,
through personal&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>I designed many complex projects outside of my area of
expertise and testing them with target audience was a
necessary part of the process. The biggest problem are simpler
projects whose solutions are often marked as <em>obvious</em>.
<em>Obvious</em> is a dangerous word. <em>Obvious</em> means other people
have the same experience, thoughts, and assumptions as I do.
Nothing could be further from the&nbsp;truth.</p>
<p>Luckily, with growing experience I can now recognize those
<em>obvious</em> solutions early on. Then I &#8220;go out and see for
myself&#8221;. I&#8217;m surprised how much I learn every&nbsp;time.</p></div>
