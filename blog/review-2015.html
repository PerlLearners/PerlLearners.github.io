<p><a href="https://medium.com/something-personal/2015-a-year-in-review-9fe4fa60f6e4a">Tin</a>
reads my&nbsp;mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have mixed feelings about writing a &#8220;year in review&#8221;. Often
times it feels like a boasting competition. Who collected the
most miles, lectures, awards or crossed off bucket list items.
On the other hand, it&#8217;s extremely healthy to stop, reflect,
recap and honestly, just remember the good (and less good)
times one had during a&nbsp;year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, benefits of reflection outweigh any mistaken
perceptions some people might have about this kind of posts.
And since I&#8217;m always pursuing knowledge and wisdom, I
won&#8217;t bore you with numbers of travel destinations and books
read. Instead, I&#8217;ll share some lessons learned during the past
year and things that have really sunk&nbsp;in.</p>
<h2>People in the same room can make&nbsp;wonders</h2>
<p><img src="/media/external/2016-01-03_people_collaborating.jpg" alt="People sketching together." /></p>
<p>People who have known each other for a long time often can&#8217;t
come to a satisfying conclusion or a solution over the phone,
email, or video conference. But put them in a room with a good
facilitator and, oh man, results happen. Somehow this physical
proximity tears down communication barriers and things
progress many times faster. Technology is wonderful, but
nothing beats&nbsp;face-to-face.</p>
<p>I witness this all the time on meetings, workshops, and design
sprints. Some people might argue that &#8220;a good team can produce
the same results remotely&#8221;. Yes, a right group of people can
do much, but two things are worth&nbsp;mentioning:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not always possible to hand-pick all colleagues or
   teammates to work with. Friction in communication is
   inevitable with some of them. By gathering everyone in one
   location, it&#8217;s possible to design the environment in a way
   to either reduce friction or completely remove&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>A good team will almost always produce better results 
   in-person than remotely, even though remote work of that
   team might outperform in-person work of a weaker&nbsp;team.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Proximity ≠&nbsp;utility</h2>
<p>Common knowledge says: if a person is in the middle of
something good, he or she will strongly benefit from it.
Mastering a language by living in a foreign country or
improving public speaking performance by attending high
profile conferences are examples that come&nbsp;easy.</p>
<p>It sounds right, but my experience in the past year tells me
it doesn&#8217;t work that way. I saw many people leave
opportunities on the table and also observed many situations
where surrounding knowledge didn&#8217;t transfer into their heads
by itself, although they were hoping it&nbsp;would.</p>
<p>A person in a privileged position has better opportunities
and a higher potential to improve, not the improvement itself.
To get it, the person has to put in work. A lot of&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Here are some of my successes and failures this&nbsp;year:</p>
<ul>
<li>I improved my German considerably. It wasn&#8217;t because I
  live in a German speaking area&#8212;I know many people who live
  here for years and still can&#8217;t read or communicate in
  German&#8212;but because I practiced it daily. I consider myself
  privileged because I have better access to resources and
  native speakers than most other&nbsp;people.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t immerse myself into local communities as much as I
  wanted to (this is a euphemism for &#8220;almost zero&#8221;). More than
  eight million people live in Switzerland, so it&#8217;s not like I
  didn&#8217;t have an&nbsp;opportunity.</li>
<li>I advanced my work-related skills by learning from my peers
  and asking for feedback and guidance. Because I was proactive
  about it, smart people at Google taught me more than I could
  learn on my&nbsp;own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Am I defined by my&nbsp;language</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit terrifying to see how little benefit I get from
Croatian, my native language, by living in a foreign country.
At work I speak English and the world around my office speaks
German (<a href="/blog/foreign-languages.html">sort of</a>). I read and write in English. To work,
exercise, get food and go through my regular day, I don&#8217;t
need to utter a word of Croatian. I use it only to talk to my
wife, my family and my old friends; almost all new people in
my life don&#8217;t know it. At the moment, it&#8217;s just a maintainer
of important&nbsp;relationships.</p>
<p>Why am I bringing this up? Because it was during 2015 that it
dawned on me I was slowly losing a use for the skill that was
honed for 30 years. My question going forward is: &#8220;Am I only
losing a skill or a part of my identity too?&#8221; All people are
loss-averse, and so am&nbsp;I.</p>
<h2>Setting goals is important for&nbsp;progress</h2>
<p>Six years ago I had a minor identity crisis. I was running a
small company with my friends and, as it usually happens in
that situation, I worked on too many things at the same time.
I wasn&#8217;t sure if I wanted or needed to improve in programming,
design, sales, marketing, or something else. I couldn&#8217;t focus,
especially on long-term goals. Then I decided to write down my
thoughts on what I really wanted to do and use that as a&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t call them <em>goals</em> back then. I called them
<em>directions</em> because they were abstract. Only later I started
to write down more specific steps and goals. Coming up and
sticking to <em>directions</em> was one of the best decisions I made
in a&nbsp;decade.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/media/external/2016-01-03_goals_and_progress.svg" />
<figcaption class="figure-caption">It&#8217;s more important to have direction and momentum than to
hit every goal exactly. Goals can be like signposts, showing
the way and not just the final destination. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It might be hard to evaluate benefits of setting goals over
weeks or months, but I&#8217;ve been doing it for six years now
and it pays off. I accomplished majority of things I had
written down and even if I didn&#8217;t finish something, I still
made some progress. Writing down goals is good for reflection
too. I can go back two or three years, see what I aimed at and
where I am now. Although I did it for some time before joining
Google, I improved goal setting by observing how Google does
<a href="https://library.gv.com/how-google-sets-goals-okrs-a1f69b0b72c7#.re3kjg90e">Objectives and Key Results</a>.</p>
<p>Goal setting is an old and proven technique. Here are some
quick&nbsp;tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goals should be <span class="caps">SMART</span>&#8212;Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
  Realistic, and Timely. Goals with at least one factor
  missing are less likely to be&nbsp;accomplished.</li>
<li>Goals can change. Stuff happens. Life is&nbsp;complicated.</li>
<li>Goals should be written down and reread every month or two,
  or before a bigger personal or professional decision. They
  are not mantras or affirmations to be repeated every&nbsp;day.</li>
</ul>
<p>2016, I&#8217;m&nbsp;ready!</p></div>
